Have you ever experienced you want to open up a file from the Finder but was opened with Xcode?

Here’s how you can set the default MacOS IDE to VS Code within 1 minute.

First select the file you want to open in Finder and press `command` + `i` , and it will open up the overall info of your file. Then look for `"Open with:"` section, click on it, and you’ll see `"Xcode (default)"`. Change it to `"Visual Studio Code"`, and you’re good to go!
