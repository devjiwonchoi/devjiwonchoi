When opening a `.json` file on macOS, have you ever been annoyed when it opens up in Xcode by default?

Since the boot time is **TOO LONG**, I found a way to use VS Code for opening files like `.json`.

1. Select the file you want to open in Finder and right click, select `"Get Info"`.
2. Find `"Open with:"` section in the info, click on it, and youâ€™ll see `"Xcode (default)"`.
3. Change it to `"Visual Studio Code"` and click `"Change All..."`.
4. Open the file again, and it should open in VS Code.
