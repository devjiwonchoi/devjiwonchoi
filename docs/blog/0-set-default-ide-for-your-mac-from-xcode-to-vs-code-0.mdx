Have you ever experienced you want to open up a file from the Finder but was opened with Xcode?

Here’s how you can set the default MacOS IDE to VS Code within 1 minute.

First select the file you want to open in Finder and press `command` + `i` .

It’ll open up the overall info of your file.

Then look for `Open with:` section, click on it, and you’ll see `Xcode (default)`.

Change it to `Visual Studio Code`, and you’re good to go!
