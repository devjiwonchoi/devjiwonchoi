You use React Components to build user interfaces, and Next.js for additional features and optimizations.\n\nUnder the hood, Next.js also abstracts and automatically configures tooling needed for React, like bundling, compiling, and more. This allows you to focus on building your application instead of spending time with configuration.\n\nWhether you're an individual developer or part of a larger team, Next.js can help you build interactive, dynamic, and fast React applications.\n\n## Main Features\n\nSome of the main Next.js features include:\n\n| Feature                                                                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| [Routing](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing)                   | A file-system based router built on top of Server Components that supports layouts, nested routing, loading states, error handling, and more.                                                    |\n| [Rendering](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering)               | Client-side and Server-side Rendering with Client and Server Components. Further optimized with Static and Dynamic Rendering on the server with Next.js. Streaming on Edge and Node.js runtimes. |\n| [Data Fetching](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching)       | Simplified data fetching with async/await in Server Components, and an extended `fetch` API for request memoization, data caching and revalidation.                                              |\n| [Styling](/docs/app/building-your-application/styling)                   | Support for your preferred styling methods, including CSS Modules, Tailwind CSS, and CSS-in-JS                                                                                                   |\n| [Optimizations](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing)          | Image, Fonts, and Script Optimizations to improve your application's Core Web Vitals and User Experience.                                                                                        |\n| [TypeScript](/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/typescript) | Improved support for TypeScript, with better type checking and more efficient compilation, as well as custom TypeScript Plugin and type checker.                                                 |\n\n## How to Use These Docs\n\nOn the left side of the screen, you'll find the docs navbar. The pages of the docs are organized sequentially, from basic to advanced, so you can follow them step-by-step when building your application. However, you can read them in any order or skip to the pages that apply to your use case.\n\nOn the right side of the screen, you'll see a table of contents that makes it easier to navigate between sections of a page. If you need to quickly find a page, you can use the search bar at the top, or the search shortcut (`Ctrl+K` or `Cmd+K`).\n\nTo get started, check out the [Installation](/docs/getting-started/installation) guide.\n\n## App Router vs Pages Router\n\nNext.js has two different routers: the App Router and the Pages Router. The App Router is a newer router that allows you to use React's latest features, such as Server Components and Streaming. The Pages Router is the original Next.js router, which allowed you to build server-rendered React applications and continues to be supported for older Next.js applications.\n\nAt the top of the sidebar, you'll notice a dropdown menu that allows you to switch between the **App Router** and the **Pages Router** features. Since there are features that are unique to each directory, it's important to keep track of which tab is selected.\n\nThe breadcrumbs at the top of the page will also indicate whether you're viewing App Router docs or Pages Router docs.\n\n## Pre-Requisite Knowledge\n\nAlthough our docs are designed to be beginner-friendly, we need to establish a baseline so that the docs can stay focused on Next.js functionality. We'll make sure to provide links to relevant documentation whenever we introduce a new concept.\n\nTo get the most out of our docs, it's recommended that you have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and React. If you need to brush up on your React skills, check out our [React Foundations Course](/learn/react-foundations), which will introduce you to the fundamentals. Then, learn more about Next.js by [building a dashboard application](/learn/dashboard-app).\n\n## Accessibility\n\nFor optimal accessibility when using a screen reader while reading the docs, we recommend using Firefox and NVDA, or Safari and VoiceOver.\n\n## Join our Community\n\nIf you have questions about anything related to Next.js, you're always welcome to ask our community on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions), [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/bUG2bvbtHy), [Twitter](https://x.com/nextjs), and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/nextjs).\n"},{"path":"docs/01-getting-started/01-installation.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/01-getting-started/01-installation.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/installation","sha":"8a3c77058b55312205d59cf0cbf024ed546becbe","size":6983,"content":"---\ntitle: Installation\ndescription: Create a new Next.js application with `create-next-app`. Set up TypeScript, styles, and configure your `next.config.js` file.\nrelated:\n  title: Next Steps\n  description: Learn about the files and folders in your Next.js project.\n  links:\n    - getting-started/project-structure\n---\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\n- [Node.js 18.17](https://nodejs.org/) or later.\n- macOS, Windows (including WSL), and Linux are supported.\n\n## Automatic Installation\n\nWe recommend starting a new Next.js app using [`create-next-app`](/docs/app/api-reference/create-next-app), which sets up everything automatically for you. To create a project, run:\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nnpx create-next-app@latest\n```\n\nOn installation, you'll see the following prompts:\n\n```txt filename=\"Terminal\"\nWhat is your project named? my-app\nWould you like to use TypeScript? No / Yes\nWould you like to use ESLint? No / Yes\nWould you like to use Tailwind CSS? No / Yes\nWould you like your code inside a `src/` directory? No / Yes\nWould you like to use App Router? (recommended) No / Yes\nWould you like to use Turbopack for `next dev`?  No / Yes\nWould you like to customize the import alias (`@/*` by default)? No / Yes\nWhat import alias would you like configured? @/*\n```\n\nAfter the prompts, `create-next-app` will create a folder with your project name and install the required dependencies.\n\nIf you're new to Next.js, see the [project structure](/docs/getting-started/project-structure) docs for an overview of all the possible files and folders in your application.\n\n> **Good to know**:\n>\n> - Next.js now ships with [TypeScript](/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/typescript), [ESLint](/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/eslint), and [Tailwind CSS](/docs/app/building-your-application/styling/tailwind-css) configuration by default.\n> - You can optionally use a [`src` directory](/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/src-directory) in the root of your project to separate your application's code from configuration files.\n\n## Manual Installation\n\nTo manually create a new Next.js app, install the required packages:\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nnpm install next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest\n```\n\nOpen your `package.json` file and add the following `scripts`:\n\n```json filename=\"package.json\"\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"dev\": \"next dev\",\n    \"build\": \"next build\",\n    \"start\": \"next start\",\n    \"lint\": \"next lint\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThese scripts refer to the different stages of developing an application:\n\n- `dev`: runs [`next dev`](/docs/app/api-reference/next-cli#development) to start Next.js in development mode.\n- `build`: runs [`next build`](/docs/app/api-reference/next-cli#build) to build the application for production usage.\n- `start`: runs [`next start`](/docs/app/api-reference/next-cli#production) to start a Next.js production server.\n- `lint`: runs [`next lint`](/docs/app/api-reference/next-cli#lint) to set up Next.js' built-in ESLint configuration.\n\n### Creating directories\n\nNext.js uses file-system routing, which means the routes in your application are determined by how you structure your files.\n\n#### The `app` directory\n\nFor new applications, we recommend using the [App Router](/docs/app). This router allows you to use React's latest features and is an evolution of the [Pages Router](/docs/pages) based on community feedback.\n\nCreate an `app/` folder, then add a `layout.tsx` and `page.tsx` file. These will be rendered when the user visits the root of your application (`/`).\n\n<Image\n  alt=\"App Folder Structure\"\n  srcLight=\"/docs/light/app-getting-started.png\"\n  srcDark=\"/docs/dark/app-getting-started.png\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"363\"\n/>\n\nCreate a [root layout](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/layouts-and-templates#root-layout-required) inside `app/layout.tsx` with the required `<html>` and `<body>` tags:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/layout.tsx\" switcher\nexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <body>{children}</body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/layout.js\" switcher\nexport default function RootLayout({ children }) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <body>{children}</body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nFinally, create a home page `app/page.tsx` with some initial content:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/page.tsx\" switcher\nexport default function Page() {\n  return <h1>Hello, Next.js!</h1>\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/page.js\" switcher\nexport default function Page() {\n  return <h1>Hello, Next.js!</h1>\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know**: If you forget to create `layout.tsx`, Next.js will automatically create this file when running the development server with `next dev`.\n\nLearn more about [using the App Router](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/defining-routes).\n\n#### The `pages` directory (optional)\n\nIf you prefer to use the Pages Router instead of the App Router, you can create a `pages/` directory at the root of your project.\n\nThen, add an `index.tsx` file inside your `pages` folder. This will be your home page (`/`):\n\n```tsx filename=\"pages/index.tsx\" switcher\nexport default function Page() {\n  return <h1>Hello, Next.js!</h1>\n}\n```\n\nNext, add an `_app.tsx` file inside `pages/` to define the global layout. Learn more about the [custom App file](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/custom-app).\n\n```tsx filename=\"pages/_app.tsx\" switcher\nimport type { AppProps } from 'next/app'\n\nexport default function App({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {\n  return <Component {...pageProps} />\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"pages/_app.js\" switcher\nexport default function App({ Component, pageProps }) {\n  return <Component {...pageProps} />\n}\n```\n\nFinally, add a `_document.tsx` file inside `pages/` to control the initial response from the server. Learn more about the [custom Document file](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/custom-document).\n\n```tsx filename=\"pages/_document.tsx\" switcher\nimport { Html, Head, Main, NextScript } from 'next/document'\n\nexport default function Document() {\n  return (\n    <Html>\n      <Head />\n      <body>\n        <Main />\n        <NextScript />\n      </body>\n    </Html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nLearn more about [using the Pages Router](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts).\n\n> **Good to know**: Although you can use both routers in the same project, routes in `app` will be prioritized over `pages`. We recommend using only one router in your new project to avoid confusion.\n\n#### The `public` folder (optional)\n\nCreate a `public` folder to store static assets such as images, fonts, etc. Files inside `public` directory can then be referenced by your code starting from the base URL (`/`).\n\n## Run the Development Server\n\n1. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.\n2. Visit `http://localhost:3000` to view your application.\n3. Edit `app/page.tsx` (or `pages/index.tsx`) file and save it to see the updated result in your browser.\n"},{"path":"docs/01-getting-started/index.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/01-getting-started/index.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started","sha":"df84fb94cf1350dd8b0ee4edcd44cdcd1ceb300f","size":106,"content":"---\ntitle: Getting Started\ndescription: Learn how to create full-stack web applications with Next.js.\n---\n"},{"path":"docs/01-getting-started/02-project-structure.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/01-getting-started/02-project-structure.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/project-structure","sha":"1b0c06c68950723be15127db2b824da2114ff482","size":15638,"content":"---\ntitle: Next.js Project Structure\nnav_title: Project Structure\ndescription: A list of folders and files conventions in a Next.js project\n---\n\nThis page provides an overview of the project structure of a Next.js application.

Docs Contribution Guide\nnav_title: Contribution Guide\ndescription: Learn how to contribute to Next.js Documentation\n---\n\nWelcome to the Next.js Docs Contribution Guide! We're excited to have you here.\n\nThis page provides instructions on how to edit the Next.js documentation. Our goal is to ensure that everyone in the community feels empowered to contribute and improve our docs.\n\n## Why Contribute?\n\nOpen-source work is never done, and neither is documentation. Contributing to docs is a good way for beginners to get involved in open-source and for experienced developers to clarify more complex topics while sharing their knowledge with the community.\n\nBy contributing to the Next.js docs, you're helping us build a more robust learning resource for all developers. Whether you've found a typo, a confusing section, or you've realized that a particular topic is missing, your contributions are welcomed and appreciated.\n\n## How to Contribute\n\nThe docs content can be found on the [Next.js repo](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/docs). To contribute, you can edit the files directly on GitHub or clone the repo and edit the files locally.\n\n### GitHub Workflow\n\nIf you're new to GitHub, we recommend reading the [GitHub Open Source Guide](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#opening-a-pull-request) to learn how to fork a repository, create a branch, and submit a pull request.\n\n> **Good to know**: The underlying docs code lives in a private codebase that is synced to the Next.js public repo. This means that you can't preview the docs locally. However, you'll see your changes on [nextjs.org](https://nextjs.org/docs) after merging a pull request.\n\n### Writing MDX\n\nThe docs are written in [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/), a markdown format that supports JSX syntax. This allows us to embed React components in the docs. See the [GitHub Markdown Guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) for a quick overview of markdown syntax.\n\n### VSCode\n\n#### Previewing Changes Locally\n\nVSCode has a built-in markdown previewer that you can use to see your edits locally. To enable the previewer for MDX files, you'll need to add a configuration option to your user settings.\n\nOpen the command palette (`⌘ + ⇧ + P` on Mac or `Ctrl + Shift + P` on Windows) and search from `Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)`.\n\nThen, add the following line to your `settings.json` file:\n\n```json filename=\"settings.json\"\n{\n  \"files.associations\": {\n    \"*.mdx\": \"markdown\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNext, open the command palette again, and search for `Markdown: Preview File` or `Markdown: Open Preview to the Side`. This will open a preview window where you can see your formatted changes.\n\n#### Extensions\n\nWe also recommend the following extensions for VSCode users:\n\n- [MDX](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=unifiedjs.vscode-mdx): Intellisense and syntax highlighting for MDX.\n- [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode): Format MDX files on save.\n\n### Review Process\n\nOnce you've submitted your contribution, the Next.js or Developer Experience teams will review your changes, provide feedback, and merge the pull request when it's ready.\n\nPlease let us know if you have any questions or need further assistance in your PR's comments. Thank you for contributing to the Next.js docs and being a part of our community!\n\n> **Tip:** Run `pnpm prettier-fix` to run Prettier before submitting your PR.\n\n## File Structure\n\nThe docs use **file-system routing**. Each folder and files inside [`/docs`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/docs) represent a route segment. These segments are used to generate the URL paths, navigation, and breadcrumbs.\n\nThe file structure reflects the navigation that you see on the site, and by default, navigation items are sorted alphabetically. However, we can change the order of the items by prepending a two-digit number (`00-`) to the folder or file name.\n\nFor example, in the [functions API Reference](/docs/app/api-reference/functions), the pages are sorted alphabetically because it makes it easier for developers to find a specific function:\n\n```txt\n03-functions\n├── cookies.mdx\n├── draft-mode.mdx\n├── fetch.mdx\n└── ...\n```\n\nBut, in the [routing section](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing), the files are prefixed with a two-digit number, sorted in the order developers should learn these concepts:\n\n```txt\n02-routing\n├── 01-defining-routes.mdx\n├── 02-pages-and-layouts.mdx\n├── 03-linking-and-navigating.mdx\n└── ...\n```\n\nTo quickly find a page, you can use `⌘ + P` (Mac) or `Ctrl + P` (Windows) to open the search bar on VSCode. Then, type the slug of the page you're looking for. E.g. `defining-routes`\n\n> **Why not use a manifest?**\n>\n> We considered using a manifest file (another popular way to generate the docs navigation), but we found that a manifest would quickly get out of sync with the files. File-system routing forces us to think about the structure of the docs and feels more native to Next.js.\n\n## Metadata\n\nEach page has a metadata block at the top of the file separated by three dashes.\n\n### Required Fields\n\nThe following fields are **required**:\n\n| Field         | Description                                                                  |\n| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `title`       | The page's `<h1>` title, used for SEO and OG Images.                         |\n| `description` | The page's description, used in the `<meta name=\"description\">` tag for SEO. |\n\n```yaml filename=\"required-fields.mdx\"\n---\ntitle: Page Title\ndescription: Page Description\n---\n```\n\nIt's good practice to limit the page title to 2-3 words (e.g. Optimizing Images) and the description to 1-2 sentences (e.g. Learn how to optimize images in Next.js).\n\n### Optional Fields\n\nThe following fields are **optional**:\n\n| Field       | Description                                                                                                                                        |\n| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `nav_title` | Overrides the page's title in the navigation. This is useful when the page's title is too long to fit. If not provided, the `title` field is used. |\n| `source`    | Pulls content into a shared page. See [Shared Pages](#shared-pages).                                                                               |\n| `related`   | A list of related pages at the bottom of the document. These will automatically be turned into cards. See [Related Links](#related-links).         |\n\n```yaml filename=\"optional-fields.mdx\"\n---\nnav_title: Nav Item Title\nsource: app/building-your-application/optimizing/images\nrelated:\n  description: See the image component API reference.\n  links:\n    - app/api-reference/components/image\n---\n```\n\n## `App` and `Pages` Docs\n\nSince most of the features in the **App Router** and **Pages Router** are completely different, their docs for each are kept in separate sections (`02-app` and `03-pages`). However, there are a few features that are shared between them.\n\n### Shared Pages\n\nTo avoid content duplication and risk the content becoming out of sync, we use the `source` field to pull content from one page into another. For example, the `<Link>` component behaves _mostly_ the same in **App** and **Pages**. Instead of duplicating the content, we can pull the content from `app/.../link.mdx` into `pages/.../link.mdx`:\n\n```mdx filename=\"app/.../link.mdx\"\n---\ntitle: <Link>\ndescription: API reference for the <Link> component.\n---\n\nThis API reference will help you understand how to use the props\nand configuration options available for the Link Component.\n```\n\n```mdx filename=\"pages/.../link.mdx\"\n---\ntitle: <Link>\ndescription: API reference for the <Link> component.\nsource: app/api-reference/components/link\n---\n\n{/* DO NOT EDIT THIS PAGE. */}\n{/* The content of this page is pulled from the source above. */}\n```\n\nWe can therefore edit the content in one place and have it reflected in both sections.\n\n### Shared Content\n\nIn shared pages, sometimes there might be content that is **App Router** or **Pages Router** specific. For example, the `<Link>` component has a `shallow` prop that is only available in **Pages** but not in **App**.\n\nTo make sure the content only shows in the correct router, we can wrap content blocks in an `<AppOnly>` or `<PagesOnly>` components:\n\n```mdx filename=\"app/.../link.mdx\"\nThis content is shared between App and Pages.\n\n<PagesOnly>\n\nThis content will only be shown on the Pages docs.\n\n</PagesOnly>\n\nThis content is shared between App and Pages.\n```\n\nYou'll likely use these components for examples and code blocks.\n\n## Code Blocks\n\nCode blocks should contain a minimum working example that can be copied and pasted. This means that the code should be able to run without any additional configuration.\n\nFor example, if you're showing how to use the `<Link>` component, you should include the `import` statement and the `<Link>` component itself.\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/page.tsx\"\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return <Link href=\"/about\">About</Link>\n}\n```\n\nAlways run examples locally before committing them. This will ensure that the code is up-to-date and working.\n\n### Language and Filename\n\nCode blocks should have a header that includes the language and the `filename`. Add a `filename` prop to render a special Terminal icon that helps orientate users where to input the command. For example:\n\n````mdx filename=\"code-example.mdx\"\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nnpx create-next-app\n```\n````\n\nMost examples in the docs are written in `tsx` and `jsx`, and a few in `bash`. However, you can use any supported language, here's the [full list](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki/blob/main/docs/languages.md#all-languages).\n\nWhen writing JavaScript code blocks, we use the following language and extension combinations.\n\n|                                | Language | Extension |\n| ------------------------------ | -------- | --------- |\n| JavaScript files with JSX code | ```jsx   | .js       |\n| JavaScript files without JSX   | ```js    | .js       |\n| TypeScript files with JSX      | ```tsx   | .tsx      |\n| TypeScript files without JSX   | ```ts    | .ts       |\n\n### TS and JS Switcher\n\nAdd a language switcher to toggle between TypeScript and JavaScript. Code blocks should be TypeScript first with a JavaScript version to accommodate users.\n\nCurrently, we write TS and JS examples one after the other, and link them with `switcher` prop:\n\n````mdx filename=\"code-example.mdx\"\n```tsx filename=\"app/page.tsx\" switcher\n\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/page.js\" switcher\n\n```\n````\n\n> **Good to know**: We plan to automatically compile TypeScript snippets to JavaScript in the future. In the meantime, you can use [transform.tools](https://transform.tools/typescript-to-javascript).\n\n### Line Highlighting\n\nCode lines can be highlighted. This is useful when you want to draw attention to a specific part of the code. You can highlight lines by passing a number to the `highlight` prop.\n\n**Single Line:** `highlight={1}`\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/page.tsx\" {1}\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return <Link href=\"/about\">About</Link>\n}\n```\n\n**Multiple Lines:** `highlight={1,3}`\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/page.tsx\" highlight={1,3}\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return <Link href=\"/about\">About</Link>\n}\n```\n\n**Range of Lines:** `highlight={1-5}`\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/page.tsx\" highlight={1-5}\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return <Link href=\"/about\">About</Link>\n}\n```\n\n## Icons\n\nThe following icons are available for use in the docs:\n\n```mdx filename=\"mdx-icon.mdx\"\n<Check size={18} />\n<Cross size={18} />\n```\n\n**Output:**\n\n<Check size={18} />\n<Cross size={18} />\n\nWe do not use emojis in the docs.\n\n## Notes\n\nFor information that is important but not critical, use notes. Notes are a good way to add information without distracting the user from the main content.\n\n```mdx filename=\"notes.mdx\"\n> **Good to know**: This is a single line note.\n\n> **Good to know**:\n>\n> - We also use this format for multi-line notes.\n> - There are sometimes multiple items worth knowing or keeping in mind.\n```\n\n**Output:**\n\n> **Good to know**: This is a single line note.\n\n> **Good to know**:\n>\n> - We also use this format for multi-line notes.\n> - There are sometimes multiple item worths knowing or keeping in mind.\n\n## Related Links\n\nRelated Links guide the user's learning journey by adding links to logical next steps.\n\n- Links will be displayed in cards under the main content of the page.\n- Links will be automatically generated for pages that have child pages. For example, the [Optimizing](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing) section has links to all of its child pages.\n\nCreate related links using the `related` field in the page's metadata.\n\n```yaml filename=\"example.mdx\"\n---\nrelated:\n  description: Learn how to quickly get started with your first application.\n  links:\n    - app/building-your-application/routing/defining-routes\n    - app/building-your-application/data-fetching\n    - app/api-reference/file-conventions/page\n---\n```\n\n### Nested Fields\n\n| Field         | Required? | Description                                                                                                                                               |\n| ------------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `title`       | Optional  | The title of the card list. Defaults to **Next Steps**.                                                                                                   |\n| `description` | Optional  | The description of the card list.                                                                                                                         |\n| `links`       | Required  | A list of links to other doc pages. Each list item should be a relative URL path (without a leading slash) e.g. `app/api-reference/file-conventions/page` |\n\n## Diagrams\n\nDiagrams are a great way to explain complex concepts. We use [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) to create diagrams, following Vercel's design guide.\n\nThe diagrams currently live in the `/public` folder in our private Next.js site. If you'd like to update or add a diagram, please open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/new?assignees=&labels=template%3A+documentation&projects=&template=4.docs_request.yml&title=Docs%3A+) with your ideas.\n\n## Custom Components and HTML\n\nThese are the React Components available for the docs: `<Image />` (next/image), `<PagesOnly />`, `<AppOnly />`, `<Cross />`, and `<Check />`. We do not allow raw HTML in the docs besides the `<details>` tag.\n\nIf you have ideas for new components, please open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/new/choose).\n\n## Style Guide\n\nThis section contains guidelines for writing docs for those who are new to technical writing.\n\n### Page Templates\n\nWhile we don't have a strict template for pages, there are page sections you'll see repeated across the docs:\n\n- **Overview:** The first paragraph of a page should tell the user what the feature is and what it's used for. Followed by a minimum working example or its API reference.\n- **Convention:** If the feature has a convention, it should be explained here.\n- **Examples**: Show how the feature can be used with different use cases.\n- **API Tables**: API Pages should have an overview table at the of the page with jump-to-section links (when possible).\n- **Next Steps (Related Links)**: Add links to related pages to guide the user's learning journey.\n\nFeel free to add these sections as needed.\n\n### Page Types\n\nDocs pages are also split into two categories: Conceptual and Reference.\n\n- **Conceptual** pages are used to explain a concept or feature. They are usually longer and contain more information than reference pages. In the Next.js docs, conceptual pages are found in the **Building Your Application** section.\n- **Reference** pages are used to explain a specific API. They are usually shorter and more focused. In the Next.js docs, reference pages are found in the **API Reference** section.\n\n> **Good to know**: Depending on the page you're contributing to, you may need to follow a different voice and style. For example, conceptual pages are more instructional and use the word _you_ to address the user. Reference pages are more technical, they use more imperative words like \"create, update, accept\" and tend to omit the word _you_.\n\n### Voice\n\nHere are some guidelines to maintain a consistent style and voice across the docs:\n\n- Write clear, concise sentences. Avoid tangents.\n  - If you find yourself using a lot of commas, consider breaking the sentence into multiple sentences or use a list.\n  - Swap out complex words for simpler ones. For example, _use_ instead of _utilize_.\n- Be mindful with the word _this_. It can be ambiguous and confusing, don't be afraid to repeat the subject of the sentence if unclear.\n  - For example, _Next.js uses React_ instead of _Next.js uses this_.\n- Use an active voice instead of passive. An active sentence is easier to read.\n  - For example, _Next.js uses React_ instead of _React is used by Next.js_. If you find yourself using words like _was_ and _by_ you may be using a passive voice.\n- Avoid using words like _easy_, _quick_, _simple_, _just_, etc. This is subjective and can be discouraging to users.\n- Avoid negative words like _don't_, _can't_, _won't_, etc. This can be discouraging to readers.\n  - For example, _\"You can use the `Link` component to create links between pages\"_ instead of _\"Don't use the `<a>` tag to create links between pages\"_.\n- Write in second person (you/your). This is more personal and engaging.\n- Use gender-neutral language. Use _developers_, _users_, or _readers_, when referring to the audience.\n- If adding code examples, ensure they are properly formatted and working.\n\nWhile these guidelines are not exhaustive, they should help you get started.

Next.js uses the following Browserslist configuration by default:\n\n```json filename=\"package.json\"\n{\n  \"browserslist\": [\n    \"chrome 64\",\n    \"edge 79\",\n    \"firefox 67\",\n    \"opera 51\",\n    \"safari 12\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n## Polyfills\n\nWe inject [widely used polyfills](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/packages/next-polyfill-nomodule/src/index.js), including:\n\n- [**fetch()**](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) — Replacing: `whatwg-fetch` and `unfetch`.\n- [**URL**](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/URL) — Replacing: the [`url` package (Node.js API)](https://nodejs.org/api/url.html).\n- [**Object.assign()**](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/assign) — Replacing: `object-assign`, `object.assign`, and `core-js/object/assign`.\n\nIf any of your dependencies include these polyfills, they’ll be eliminated automatically from the production build to avoid duplication.\n\nIn addition, to reduce bundle size, Next.js will only load these polyfills for browsers that require them. The majority of the web traffic globally will not download these polyfills.\n\n### Custom Polyfills\n\nIf your own code or any external npm dependencies require features not supported by your target browsers (such as IE 11), you need to add polyfills yourself.\n\nIn this case, you should add a top-level import for the **specific polyfill** you need in your [Custom `<App>`](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/custom-app) or the individual component.\n\n## JavaScript Language Features\n\nNext.js allows you to use the latest JavaScript features out of the box. In addition to [ES6 features](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features), Next.js also supports:\n\n- [Async/await](https://github.com/tc39/ecmascript-asyncawait) (ES2017)\n- [Object Rest/Spread Properties](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-object-rest-spread) (ES2018)\n- [Dynamic `import()`](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-dynamic-import) (ES2020)\n- [Optional Chaining](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-optional-chaining) (ES2020)\n- [Nullish Coalescing](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-nullish-coalescing) (ES2020)\n- [Class Fields](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-class-fields) and [Static Properties](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-static-class-features) (ES2022)\n- and more!\n\n### TypeScript Features\n\nNext.js has built-in TypeScript support.

By adding accessibility features to Next.js by default, we aim to make the Web more inclusive for everyone.\n\n## Route Announcements\n\nWhen transitioning between pages rendered on the server (e.g. using the `<a href>` tag) screen readers and other assistive technology announce the page title when the page loads so that users understand that the page has changed.\n\nIn addition to traditional page navigations, Next.js also supports client-side transitions for improved performance (using `next/link`). To ensure that client-side transitions are also announced to assistive technology, Next.js includes a route announcer by default.\n\nThe Next.js route announcer looks for the page name to announce by first inspecting `document.title`, then the `<h1>` element, and finally the URL pathname. For the most accessible user experience, ensure that each page in your application has a unique and descriptive title.\n\n## Linting\n\nNext.js provides an [integrated ESLint experience](/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/eslint) out of the box, including custom rules for Next.js.

Fast Refresh is enabled by default in all\nNext.js applications on **9.4 or newer**. With Next.js Fast Refresh enabled,\nmost edits should be visible within a second, **without losing component\nstate**.\n\n## How It Works\n\n- If you edit a file that **only exports React component(s)**, Fast Refresh will\n  update the code only for that file, and re-render your component. You can edit\n  anything in that file, including styles, rendering logic, event handlers, or\n  effects.\n- If you edit a file with exports that _aren't_ React components, Fast Refresh\n  will re-run both that file, and the other files importing it. So if both\n  `Button.js` and `Modal.js` import `theme.js`, editing `theme.js` will update\n  both components.\n- Finally, if you **edit a file** that's **imported by files outside of the\n  React tree**, Fast Refresh **will fall back to doing a full reload**. You\n  might have a file which renders a React component but also exports a value\n  that is imported by a **non-React component**. For example, maybe your\n  component also exports a constant, and a non-React utility file imports it. In\n  that case, consider migrating the constant to a separate file and importing it\n  into both files. This will re-enable Fast Refresh to work. Other cases can\n  usually be solved in a similar way.\n\n## Error Resilience\n\n### Syntax Errors\n\nIf you make a syntax error during development, you can fix it and save the file\nagain. The error will disappear automatically, so you won't need to reload the\napp. **You will not lose component state**.\n\n### Runtime Errors\n\nIf you make a mistake that leads to a runtime error inside your component,\nyou'll be greeted with a contextual overlay. Fixing the error will automatically\ndismiss the overlay, without reloading the app.\n\nComponent state will be retained if the error did not occur during rendering. If\nthe error did occur during rendering, React will remount your application using\nthe updated code.\n\nIf you have [error boundaries](https://react.dev/reference/react/Component#catching-rendering-errors-with-an-error-boundary)\nin your app (which is a good idea for graceful failures in production), they\nwill retry rendering on the next edit after a rendering error. This means having\nan error boundary can prevent you from always getting reset to the root app\nstate. However, keep in mind that error boundaries shouldn't be _too_ granular.\nThey are used by React in production, and should always be designed\nintentionally.\n\n## Limitations\n\nFast Refresh tries to preserve local React state in the component you're\nediting, but only if it's safe to do so. Here's a few reasons why you might see\nlocal state being reset on every edit to a file:\n\n- Local state is not preserved for class components (only function components\n  and Hooks preserve state).\n- The file you're editing might have _other_ exports in addition to a React\n  component.\n- Sometimes, a file would export the result of calling a higher-order component\n  like `HOC(WrappedComponent)`. If the returned component is a\n  class, its state will be reset.\n- Anonymous arrow functions like `export default () => <div />;` cause Fast Refresh to not preserve local component state. For large codebases you can use our [`name-default-component` codemod](/docs/pages/building-your-application/upgrading/codemods#name-default-component).\n\nAs more of your codebase moves to function components and Hooks, you can expect\nstate to be preserved in more cases.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Fast Refresh preserves React local state in function components (and Hooks) by\n  default.\n- Sometimes you might want to _force_ the state to be reset, and a component to\n  be remounted. For example, this can be handy if you're tweaking an animation\n  that only happens on mount. To do this, you can add `// @refresh reset`\n  anywhere in the file you're editing. This directive is local to the file, and\n  instructs Fast Refresh to remount components defined in that file on every\n  edit.\n- You can put `console.log` or `debugger;` into the components you edit during\n  development.\n- Remember that imports are case sensitive. Both fast and full refresh can fail,\n  when your import doesn't match the actual filename.\n  For example, `'./header'` vs `'./Header'`.\n\n## Fast Refresh and Hooks\n\nWhen possible, Fast Refresh attempts to preserve the state of your component\nbetween edits. In particular, `useState` and `useRef` preserve their previous\nvalues as long as you don't change their arguments or the order of the Hook\ncalls.\n\nHooks with dependencies—such as `useEffect`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback`—will\n_always_ update during Fast Refresh. Their list of dependencies will be ignored\nwhile Fast Refresh is happening.\n\nFor example, when you edit `useMemo(() => x * 2, [x])` to\n`useMemo(() => x * 10, [x])`, it will re-run even though `x` (the dependency)\nhas not changed. If React didn't do that, your edit wouldn't reflect on the\nscreen!\n\nSometimes, this can lead to unexpected results. For example, even a `useEffect`\nwith an empty array of dependencies would still re-run once during Fast Refresh.\n\nHowever, writing code resilient to occasional re-running of `useEffect` is a good practice even\nwithout Fast Refresh. It will make it easier for you to introduce new dependencies to it later on\nand it's enforced by [React Strict Mode](/docs/pages/api-reference/next-config-js/reactStrictMode),\nwhich we highly recommend enabling.\n"},{"path":"docs/04-architecture/index.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/04-architecture/index.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/architecture","sha":"5b2fde426541a81deb8b4addf90f0107314f1b82","size":130,"content":"---\ntitle: Architecture\ndescription: How Next.js Works\n---\n\nLearn about the Next.js architecture and how it works under the hood.\n"},{"path":"docs/04-architecture/turbopack.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/04-architecture/turbopack.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/architecture/turbopack","sha":"e36d9ba360e3f15cdbf5eee3c3794ef05c46a299","size":3888,"content":"---\ntitle: Turbopack\ndescription: Turbopack is an incremental bundler optimized for JavaScript and TypeScript, written in Rust, and built into Next.js.\n---\n\n[Turbopack](https://turbo.build/pack) (beta) is an incremental bundler optimized for JavaScript and TypeScript, written in Rust, and built into Next.js.\n\n## Usage\n\nTurbopack can be used in Next.js in both the `pages` and `app` directories for faster local development. To enable Turbopack, use the `--turbo` flag when running the Next.js development server.\n\n```json filename=\"package.json\" highlight={3}\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"dev\": \"next dev --turbo\",\n    \"build\": \"next build\",\n    \"start\": \"next start\",\n    \"lint\": \"next lint\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Supported features\n\nTurbopack in Next.js requires zero-configuration for most users and can be extended for more advanced use cases. To learn more about the currently supported features for Turbopack, view the [API Reference](/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/turbo).\n\n## Unsupported features\n\nTurbopack currently only supports `next dev` and does not support `next build`. We are currently working on support for builds as we move closer towards stability.\n\nThese features are currently not supported:\n\n- [`webpack()`](/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/webpack) configuration in `next.config.js`\n  - Turbopack replaces Webpack, this means that webpack configuration is not supported.\n  - To configure Turbopack, [see the documentation](/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/turbo).\n  - A subset of [Webpack loaders](/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/turbo#webpack-loaders) are supported in Turbopack.\n- Babel (`.babelrc`)\n  - Turbopack leverages the [SWC](/docs/architecture/nextjs-compiler#why-swc) compiler for all transpilation and optimizations. This means that Babel is not included by default.\n  - If you have a `.babelrc` file, you might no longer need it because Next.js includes common Babel plugins as SWC transforms that can be enabled. You can read more about this in the [compiler documentation](docs/architecture/nextjs-compiler#supported-features).\n  - If you still need to use Babel after verifying your particular use case is not covered, you can leverage Turbopack's [support for custom webpack loaders](/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/turbo#webpack-loaders) to include `babel-loader`.\n- Creating a root layout automatically in App Router.\n  - This behavior is currently not supported since it changes input files, instead, an error will be shown for you manually add a root layout in the desired location.\n- `@next/font` (legacy font support).\n  - `@next/font` is deprecated in favor of `next/font`.

To generate a trace file, append `NEXT_TURBOPACK_TRACING=1` to the `next dev --turbo` command, this will generate a `.next/trace.log` file.\n\nWhen reporting issues related to Turbopack performance and memory usage, please include the trace file in your [GitHub](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) issue.\n"},{"path":"docs/04-architecture/nextjs-compiler.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/04-architecture/nextjs-compiler.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/architecture/nextjs-compiler","sha":"20dcc82b2f0aa1e3061c2d868ec5d4e5a666b715","size":12872,"content":"---\ntitle: Next.js Compiler\ndescription: Next.js Compiler, written in Rust, which transforms and minifies your Next.js application.\n---\n\nThe Next.js Compiler, written in Rust using [SWC](https://swc.rs/), allows Next.js to transform and minify your JavaScript code for production. This replaces Babel for individual files and Terser for minifying output bundles.\n\nCompilation using the Next.js Compiler is 17x faster than Babel and enabled by default since Next.js version 12. If you have an existing Babel configuration or are using [unsupported features](#unsupported-features), your application will opt-out of the Next.js Compiler and continue using Babel.\n\n## Why SWC?\n\n[SWC](https://swc.rs/) is an extensible Rust-based platform for the next generation of fast developer tools.\n\nSWC can be used for compilation, minification, bundling, and more – and is designed to be extended. It's something you can call to perform code transformations (either built-in or custom). Running those transformations happens through higher-level tools like Next.js.\n\nWe chose to build on SWC for a few reasons:\n\n- **Extensibility:** SWC can be used as a Crate inside Next.js, without having to fork the library or workaround design constraints.\n- **Performance:** We were able to achieve ~3x faster Fast Refresh and ~5x faster builds in Next.js by switching to SWC, with more room for optimization still in progress.\n- **WebAssembly:** Rust's support for WASM is essential for supporting all possible platforms and taking Next.js development everywhere.\n- **Community:** The Rust community and ecosystem are amazing and still growing.\n\n## Supported Features\n\n### Styled Components\n\nWe're working to port `babel-plugin-styled-components` to the Next.js Compiler.\n\nFirst, update to the latest version of Next.js: `npm install next@latest`. Then, update your `next.config.js` file:\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  compiler: {\n    styledComponents: true,\n  },\n}\n```\n\nFor advanced use cases, you can configure individual properties for styled-components compilation.\n\n> Note: `ssr` and `displayName` transforms are the main requirement for using `styled-components` in Next.js.\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  compiler: {\n    // see https://styled-components.com/docs/tooling#babel-plugin for more info on the options.\n    styledComponents: {\n      // Enabled by default in development, disabled in production to reduce file size,\n      // setting this will override the default for all environments.\n      displayName?: boolean,\n      // Enabled by default.\n      ssr?: boolean,\n      // Enabled by default.\n      fileName?: boolean,\n      // Empty by default.\n      topLevelImportPaths?: string[],\n      // Defaults to [\"index\"].\n      meaninglessFileNames?: string[],\n      // Enabled by default.\n      minify?: boolean,\n      // Enabled by default.\n      transpileTemplateLiterals?: boolean,\n      // Empty by default.\n      namespace?: string,\n      // Disabled by default.\n      pure?: boolean,\n      // Enabled by default.\n      cssProp?: boolean,\n    },\n  },\n}\n```\n\n### Jest\n\nThe Next.js Compiler transpiles your tests and simplifies configuring Jest together with Next.js including:\n\n- Auto mocking of `.css`, `.module.css` (and their `.scss` variants), and image imports\n- Automatically sets up `transform` using SWC\n- Loading `.env` (and all variants) into `process.env`\n- Ignores `node_modules` from test resolving and transforms\n- Ignoring `.next` from test resolving\n- Loads `next.config.js` for flags that enable experimental SWC transforms\n\nFirst, update to the latest version of Next.js: `npm install next@latest`. Then, update your `jest.config.js` file:\n\n```js filename=\"jest.config.js\"\nconst nextJest = require('next/jest')\n\n// Providing the path to your Next.js app which will enable loading next.config.js and .env files\nconst createJestConfig = nextJest({ dir: './' })\n\n// Any custom config you want to pass to Jest\nconst customJestConfig = {\n  setupFilesAfterEnv: ['<rootDir>/jest.setup.js'],\n}\n\n// createJestConfig is exported in this way to ensure that next/jest can load the Next.js configuration, which is async\nmodule.exports = createJestConfig(customJestConfig)\n```\n\n### Relay\n\nTo enable [Relay](https://relay.dev/) support:\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  compiler: {\n    relay: {\n      // This should match relay.config.js\n      src: './',\n      artifactDirectory: './__generated__',\n      language: 'typescript',\n      eagerEsModules: false,\n    },\n  },\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know**: In Next.js, all JavaScript files in `pages` directory are considered routes. So, for `relay-compiler` you'll need to specify `artifactDirectory` configuration settings outside of the `pages`, otherwise `relay-compiler` will generate files next to the source file in the `__generated__` directory, and this file will be considered a route, which will break production builds.\n\n### Remove React Properties\n\nAllows to remove JSX properties. This is often used for testing. Similar to `babel-plugin-react-remove-properties`.\n\nTo remove properties matching the default regex `^data-test`:\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  compiler: {\n    reactRemoveProperties: true,\n  },\n}\n```\n\nTo remove custom properties:\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  compiler: {\n    // The regexes defined here are processed in Rust so the syntax is different from\n    // JavaScript `RegExp`s. See https://docs.rs/regex.\n    reactRemoveProperties: { properties: ['^data-custom$'] },\n  },\n}\n```\n\n### Remove Console\n\nThis transform allows for removing all `console.*` calls in application code (not `node_modules`). Similar to `babel-plugin-transform-remove-console`.\n\nRemove all `console.*` calls:\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  compiler: {\n    removeConsole: true,\n  },\n}\n```\n\nRemove `console.*` output except `console.error`:\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  compiler: {\n    removeConsole: {\n      exclude: ['error'],\n    },\n  },\n}\n```\n\n### Legacy Decorators\n\nNext.js will automatically detect `experimentalDecorators` in `jsconfig.json` or `tsconfig.json`. Legacy decorators are commonly used with older versions of libraries like `mobx`.\n\nThis flag is only supported for compatibility with existing applications. We do not recommend using legacy decorators in new applications.\n\nFirst, update to the latest version of Next.js: `npm install next@latest`. Then, update your `jsconfig.json` or `tsconfig.json` file:\n\n```js\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"experimentalDecorators\": true\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### importSource\n\nNext.js will automatically detect `jsxImportSource` in `jsconfig.json` or `tsconfig.json` and apply that. This is commonly used with libraries like [Theme UI](https://theme-ui.com).\n\nFirst, update to the latest version of Next.js: `npm install next@latest`. Then, update your `jsconfig.json` or `tsconfig.json` file:\n\n```js\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"jsxImportSource\": \"theme-ui\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Emotion\n\nWe're working to port `@emotion/babel-plugin` to the Next.js Compiler.\n\nFirst, update to the latest version of Next.js: `npm install next@latest`. Then, update your `next.config.js` file:\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  compiler: {\n    emotion: boolean | {\n      // default is true. It will be disabled when build type is production.\n      sourceMap?: boolean,\n      // default is 'dev-only'.\n      autoLabel?: 'never' | 'dev-only' | 'always',\n      // default is '[local]'.\n      // Allowed values: `[local]` `[filename]` and `[dirname]`\n      // This option only works when autoLabel is set to 'dev-only' or 'always'.\n      // It allows you to define the format of the resulting label.\n      // The format is defined via string where variable parts are enclosed in square brackets [].\n      // For example labelFormat: \"my-classname--[local]\", where [local] will be replaced with the name of the variable the result is assigned to.\n      labelFormat?: string,\n      // default is undefined.\n      // This option allows you to tell the compiler what imports it should\n      // look at to determine what it should transform so if you re-export\n      // Emotion's exports, you can still use transforms.\n      importMap?: {\n        [packageName: string]: {\n          [exportName: string]: {\n            canonicalImport?: [string, string],\n            styledBaseImport?: [string, string],\n          }\n        }\n      },\n    },\n  },\n}\n```\n\n### Minification\n\nNext.js' swc compiler is used for minification by default since v13. This is 7x faster than Terser.\n\nIf Terser is still needed for any reason this can be configured.\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  swcMinify: false,\n}\n```\n\n### Module Transpilation\n\nNext.js can automatically transpile and bundle dependencies from local packages (like monorepos) or from external dependencies (`node_modules`). This replaces the `next-transpile-modules` package.\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  transpilePackages: ['@acme/ui', 'lodash-es'],\n}\n```\n\n### Modularize Imports\n\nThis option has been superseded by [`optimizePackageImports`](/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/optimizePackageImports) in Next.js 13.5. We recommend upgrading to use the new option that does not require manual configuration of import paths.\n\n## Experimental Features\n\n### SWC Trace profiling\n\nYou can generate SWC's internal transform traces as chromium's [trace event format](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CvAClvFfyA5R-PhYUmn5OOQtYMH4h6I0nSsKchNAySU/preview?mode=html#%21=).\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  experimental: {\n    swcTraceProfiling: true,\n  },\n}\n```\n\nOnce enabled, swc will generate trace named as `swc-trace-profile-${timestamp}.json` under `.next/`. Chromium's trace viewer (chrome://tracing/, https://ui.perfetto.dev/), or compatible flamegraph viewer (https://www.speedscope.app/) can load & visualize generated traces.\n\n### SWC Plugins (Experimental)\n\nYou can configure swc's transform to use SWC's experimental plugin support written in wasm to customize transformation behavior.\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  experimental: {\n    swcPlugins: [\n      [\n        'plugin',\n        {\n          ...pluginOptions,\n        },\n      ],\n    ],\n  },\n}\n```\n\n`swcPlugins` accepts an array of tuples for configuring plugins. A tuple for the plugin contains the path to the plugin and an object for plugin configuration. The path to the plugin can be an npm module package name or an absolute path to the `.wasm` binary itself.\n\n## Unsupported Features\n\nWhen your application has a `.babelrc` file, Next.js will automatically fall back to using Babel for transforming individual files. This ensures backwards compatibility with existing applications that leverage custom Babel plugins.\n\nIf you're using a custom Babel setup, [please share your configuration](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/30174). We're working to port as many commonly used Babel transformations as possible, as well as supporting plugins in the future.\n\n## Version History\n\n| Version   | Changes                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `v13.1.0` | [Module Transpilation](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-13-1#built-in-module-transpilation-stable) and [Modularize Imports](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-13-1#import-resolution-for-smaller-bundles) stable. |\n| `v13.0.0` | SWC Minifier enabled by default.                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| `v12.3.0` | SWC Minifier [stable](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-12-3#swc-minifier-stable).                                                                                                                            |\n| `v12.2.0` | [SWC Plugins](#swc-plugins-experimental) experimental support added.                                                                                                                                     |\n| `v12.1.0` | Added support for Styled Components, Jest, Relay, Remove React Properties, Legacy Decorators, Remove Console, and jsxImportSource.                                                                       |\n| `v12.0.0` | Next.js Compiler [introduced](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-12).                                                                                                                                          |\n"},{"path":"docs/03-pages/index.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/03-pages/index.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/pages","sha":"c64d435eb762d66f3cf7438c8e5fd89aa3e35281","size":569,"content":"---\ntitle: Pages Router\ndescription: Before Next.js 13, the Pages Router was the main way to create routes in Next.js with an intuitive file-system router.\n---\n\nBefore Next.js 13, the Pages Router was the main way to create routes in Next.js.

See [Next.js Compiler](/docs/architecture/nextjs-compiler) for more info.\n- The `next/image` import was renamed to `next/legacy/image`. The `next/future/image` import was renamed to `next/image`. A [codemod is available](/docs/pages/building-your-application/upgrading/codemods#next-image-to-legacy-image) to safely and automatically rename your imports.\n- The `next/link` child can no longer be `<a>`. Add the `legacyBehavior` prop to use the legacy behavior or remove the `<a>` to upgrade. A [codemod is available](/docs/pages/building-your-application/upgrading/codemods#new-link) to automatically upgrade your code.\n- The `target` configuration property has been removed and superseded by [Output File Tracing](/docs/pages/api-reference/next-config-js/output).\n\n## Migrating shared features\n\nNext.js 13 introduces a new [`app` directory](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing) with new features and conventions. However, upgrading to Next.js 13 does **not** require using the new [`app` directory](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing#the-app-router).\n\nYou can continue using `pages` with new features that work in both directories, such as the updated [Image component](#image-component), [Link component](#link-component), [Script component](#script-component), and [Font optimization](#font-optimization).\n\n### `<Image/>` Component\n\nNext.js 12 introduced many improvements to the Image Component with a temporary import: `next/future/image`. These improvements included less client-side JavaScript, easier ways to extend and style images, better accessibility, and native browser lazy loading.\n\nStarting in Next.js 13, this new behavior is now the default for `next/image`.\n\nThere are two codemods to help you migrate to the new Image Component:\n\n- [next-image-to-legacy-image](/docs/pages/building-your-application/upgrading/codemods#next-image-to-legacy-image): This codemod will safely and automatically rename `next/image` imports to `next/legacy/image` to maintain the same behavior as Next.js 12. We recommend running this codemod to quickly update to Next.js 13 automatically.\n- [next-image-experimental](/docs/pages/building-your-application/upgrading/codemods#next-image-experimental): After running the previous codemod, you can optionally run this experimental codemod to upgrade `next/legacy/image` to the new `next/image`, which will remove unused props and add inline styles. Please note this codemod is experimental and only covers static usage (such as `<Image src={img} layout=\"responsive\" />`) but not dynamic usage (such as `<Image {...props} />`).\n\nAlternatively, you can manually update by following the [migration guide](/docs/pages/building-your-application/upgrading/codemods#next-image-experimental) and also see the [legacy comparison](/docs/pages/api-reference/components/image-legacy#comparison).\n\n### `<Link>` Component\n\nThe [`<Link>` Component](/docs/pages/api-reference/components/link) no longer requires manually adding an `<a>` tag as a child. This behavior was added as an experimental option in [version 12.2](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-12-2) and is now the default. In Next.js 13, `<Link>` always renders `<a>` and allows you to forward props to the underlying tag.\n\nFor example:\n\n```jsx\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n\n// Next.js 12: `<a>` has to be nested otherwise it's excluded\n<Link href=\"/about\">\n  <a>About</a>\n</Link>\n\n// Next.js 13: `<Link>` always renders `<a>` under the hood\n<Link href=\"/about\">\n  About\n</Link>\n```\n\nTo upgrade your links to Next.js 13, you can use the [`new-link` codemod](/docs/pages/building-your-application/upgrading/codemods#new-link).\n\n### `<Script>` Component\n\nThe behavior of [`next/script`](/docs/pages/api-reference/components/script) has been updated to support both `pages` and `app`. If incrementally adopting `app`, read the [upgrade guide](/docs/pages/building-your-application/upgrading).\n\n### Font Optimization\n\nPreviously, Next.js helped you optimize fonts by inlining font CSS. Version 13 introduces the new [`next/font`](/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) module which gives you the ability to customize your font loading experience while still ensuring great performance and privacy.\n\nSee [Optimizing Fonts](/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to learn how to use `next/font`.\n"},{"path":"docs/03-pages/01-building-your-application/10-upgrading/09-version-10.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/03-pages/01-building-your-application/10-upgrading/09-version-10.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/upgrading/version-10","sha":"472672234525459e189f96db5576afde3e30983b","size":555,"content":"---\ntitle: Version 10\ndescription: Upgrade your Next.js Application from Version 9 to Version 10.\n---\n\nThere were no breaking changes between versions 9 and 10.\n\nTo upgrade to version 10, run the following command:\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nnpm i next@10\n```\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nyarn add next@10\n```\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\npnpm up next@10\n```\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nbun add next@10\n```\n\n> **Good to know:** If you are using TypeScript, ensure you also upgrade `@types/react` and `@types/react-dom` to their corresponding versions.\n"},{"path":"docs/03-pages/01-building-your-application/10-upgrading/08-version-11.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/03-pages/01-building-your-application/10-upgrading/08-version-11.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/upgrading/version-11","sha":"59f6cfaadc0f57b2bac3d3de42bc4695fd42ef94","size":6541,"content":"---\ntitle: Version 11\ndescription: Upgrade your Next.js Application from Version 10 to Version 11.\n---\n\nTo upgrade to version 11, run the following command:\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nnpm i next@11 react@17 react-dom@17\n```\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nyarn add next@11 react@17 react-dom@17\n```\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\npnpm up next@11 react@17 react-dom@17\n```\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nbun add next@11 react@17 react-dom@17\n```\n\n> **Good to know:** If you are using TypeScript, ensure you also upgrade `@types/react` and `@types/react-dom` to their corresponding versions.\n\n### Webpack 5\n\nWebpack 5 is now the default for all Next.js applications. If you did not have a custom webpack configuration, your application is already using webpack 5. If you do have a custom webpack configuration, you can refer to the [Next.js webpack 5 documentation](/docs/messages/webpack5) for upgrade guidance.\n\n### Cleaning the `distDir` is now a default\n\nThe build output directory (defaults to `.next`) is now cleared by default except for the Next.js caches. You can refer to [the cleaning `distDir` RFC](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/6009) for more information.\n\nIf your application was relying on this behavior previously you can disable the new default behavior by adding the `cleanDistDir: false` flag in `next.config.js`.\n\n### `PORT` is now supported for `next dev` and `next start`\n\nNext.js 11 supports the `PORT` environment variable to set the port the application runs on. Using `-p`/`--port` is still recommended but if you were prohibited from using `-p` in any way you can now use `PORT` as an alternative:\n\nExample:\n\n```\nPORT=4000 next start\n```\n\n### `next.config.js` customization to import images\n\nNext.js 11 supports static image imports with `next/image`. This new feature relies on being able to process image imports. If you previously added the `next-images` or `next-optimized-images` packages you can either move to the new built-in support using `next/image` or disable the feature:\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    disableStaticImages: true,\n  },\n}\n```\n\n### Remove `super.componentDidCatch()` from `pages/_app.js`\n\nThe `next/app` component's `componentDidCatch` was deprecated in Next.js 9 as it's no longer needed and has since been a no-op. In Next.js 11, it was removed.\n\nIf your `pages/_app.js` has a custom `componentDidCatch` method you can remove `super.componentDidCatch` as it is no longer needed.\n\n### Remove `Container` from `pages/_app.js`\n\nThis export was deprecated in Next.js 9 as it's no longer needed and has since been a no-op with a warning during development. In Next.js 11 it was removed.\n\nIf your `pages/_app.js` imports `Container` from `next/app` you can remove `Container` as it was removed. Learn more in [the documentation](/docs/messages/app-container-deprecated).\n\n### Remove `props.url` usage from page components\n\nThis property was deprecated in Next.js 4 and has since shown a warning during development. With the introduction of `getStaticProps` / `getServerSideProps` these methods already disallowed the usage of `props.url`. In Next.js 11, it was removed completely.\n\nYou can learn more in [the documentation](/docs/messages/url-deprecated).\n\n### Remove `unsized` property on `next/image`\n\nThe `unsized` property on `next/image` was deprecated in Next.js 10.0.1. You can use `layout=\"fill\"` instead. In Next.js 11 `unsized` was removed.\n\n### Remove `modules` property on `next/dynamic`\n\nThe `modules` and `render` option for `next/dynamic` were deprecated in Next.js 9.5. This was done in order to make the `next/dynamic` API closer to `React.lazy`. In Next.js 11, the `modules` and `render` options were removed.\n\nThis option hasn't been mentioned in the documentation since Next.js 8 so it's less likely that your application is using it.\n\nIf your application does use `modules` and `render` you can refer to [the documentation](/docs/messages/next-dynamic-modules).\n\n### Remove `Head.rewind`\n\n`Head.rewind` has been a no-op since Next.js 9.5, in Next.js 11 it was removed. You can safely remove your usage of `Head.rewind`.\n\n### Moment.js locales excluded by default\n\nMoment.js includes translations for a lot of locales by default. Next.js now automatically excludes these locales by default to optimize bundle size for applications using Moment.js.\n\nTo load a specific locale use this snippet:\n\n```js\nimport moment from 'moment'\nimport 'moment/locale/ja'\n\nmoment.locale('ja')\n```\n\nYou can opt-out of this new default by adding `excludeDefaultMomentLocales: false` to `next.config.js` if you do not want the new behavior, do note it's highly recommended to not disable this new optimization as it significantly reduces the size of Moment.js.\n\n### Update usage of `router.events`\n\nIn case you're accessing `router.events` during rendering, in Next.js 11 `router.events` is no longer provided during pre-rendering. Ensure you're accessing `router.events` in `useEffect`:\n\n```js\nuseEffect(() => {\n  const handleRouteChange = (url, { shallow }) => {\n    console.log(\n      `App is changing to ${url} ${\n        shallow ? 'with' : 'without'\n      } shallow routing`\n    )\n  }\n\n  router.events.on('routeChangeStart', handleRouteChange)\n\n  // If the component is unmounted, unsubscribe\n  // from the event with the `off` method:\n  return () => {\n    router.events.off('routeChangeStart', handleRouteChange)\n  }\n}, [router])\n```\n\nIf your application uses `router.router.events` which was an internal property that was not public please make sure to use `router.events` as well.\n\n## React 16 to 17\n\nReact 17 introduced a new [JSX Transform](https://reactjs.org/blog/2020/09/22/introducing-the-new-jsx-transform.html) that brings a long-time Next.js feature to the wider React ecosystem: Not having to `import React from 'react'` when using JSX. When using React 17 Next.js will automatically use the new transform. This transform does not make the `React` variable global, which was an unintended side-effect of the previous Next.js implementation. A [codemod is available](/docs/pages/building-your-application/upgrading/codemods#add-missing-react-import) to automatically fix cases where you accidentally used `React` without importing it.\n\nMost applications already use the latest version of React, with Next.js 11 the minimum React version has been updated to 17.0.2.\n\nTo upgrade you can run the following command:\n\n```\nnpm install react@latest react-dom@latest\n```\n\nOr using `yarn`:\n\n```\nyarn add react@latest react-dom@latest\n```\n"},{"path":"docs/03-pages/01-building-your-application/10-upgrading/04-from-create-react-app.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/03-pages/01-building-your-application/10-upgrading/04-from-create-react-app.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/upgrading/from-create-react-app","sha":"697335a9cdc36646cc4c6b8cfb493101ec67aba4","size":546,"content":"---\ntitle: Migrating from Create React App\ndescription: Learn how to migrate your existing React application from Create React App to Next.js.\nsource: app/building-your-application/upgrading/from-create-react-app\n---\n\n{/* DO NOT EDIT.

This new compiler is up to 17x faster than Babel when compiling individual files and up to 5x faster Fast Refresh.\n\nNext.js provides full backward compatibility with applications that have [custom Babel configuration](/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/babel). All transformations that Next.js handles by default like styled-jsx and tree-shaking of `getStaticProps` / `getStaticPaths` / `getServerSideProps` have been ported to Rust.\n\nWhen an application has a custom Babel configuration, Next.js will automatically opt-out of using SWC for compiling JavaScript/Typescript and will fall back to using Babel in the same way that it was used in Next.js 11.\n\nMany of the integrations with external libraries that currently require custom Babel transformations will be ported to Rust-based SWC transforms in the near future. These include but are not limited to:\n\n- Styled Components\n- Emotion\n- Relay\n\nIn order to prioritize transforms that will help you adopt SWC, please provide your `.babelrc` on [this feedback thread](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/30174).\n\n#### SWC replacing Terser for minification\n\nYou can opt-in to replacing Terser with SWC for minifying JavaScript up to 7x faster using a flag in `next.config.js`:\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  swcMinify: true,\n}\n```\n\nMinification using SWC is an opt-in flag to ensure it can be tested against more real-world Next.js applications before it becomes the default in Next.js 12.1. If you have feedback about minification, please leave it on [this feedback thread](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/30237).\n\n#### Improvements to styled-jsx CSS parsing\n\nOn top of the Rust-based compiler we've implemented a new CSS parser based on the one used for the styled-jsx Babel transform. This new parser has improved handling of CSS and now errors when invalid CSS is used that would previously slip through and cause unexpected behavior.\n\nBecause of this change invalid CSS will throw an error during development and `next build`. This change only affects styled-jsx usage.\n\n#### `next/image` changed wrapping element\n\n`next/image` now renders the `<img>` inside a `<span>` instead of `<div>`.\n\nIf your application has specific CSS targeting span such as `.container span`, upgrading to Next.js 12 might incorrectly match the wrapping element inside the `<Image>` component. You can avoid this by restricting the selector to a specific class such as `.container span.item` and updating the relevant component with that className, such as `<span className=\"item\" />`.\n\nIf your application has specific CSS targeting the `next/image` `<div>` tag, for example `.container div`, it may not match anymore. You can update the selector `.container span`, or preferably, add a new `<div className=\"wrapper\">` wrapping the `<Image>` component and target that instead such as `.container .wrapper`.\n\nThe `className` prop is unchanged and will still be passed to the underlying `<img>` element.\n\nSee the [documentation](/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/images#styling) for more info.\n\n#### HMR connection now uses a WebSocket\n\nPreviously, Next.js used a [server-sent events](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events) connection to receive HMR events. Next.js 12 now uses a WebSocket connection.\n\nIn some cases when proxying requests to the Next.js dev server, you will need to ensure the upgrade request is handled correctly. For example, in `nginx` you would need to add the following configuration:\n\n```nginx\nlocation /_next/webpack-hmr {\n    proxy_pass http://localhost:3000/_next/webpack-hmr;\n    proxy_http_version 1.1;\n    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;\n    proxy_set_header Connection \"upgrade\";\n}\n```\n\nIf you are using Apache (2.x), you can add the following configuration to enable web sockets to the server. Review the port, host name and server names.\n\n```\n<VirtualHost *:443>\n # ServerName yourwebsite.local\n ServerName \"${WEBSITE_SERVER_NAME}\"\n ProxyPass / http://localhost:3000/\n ProxyPassReverse / http://localhost:3000/\n # Next.js 12 uses websocket\n <Location /_next/webpack-hmr>\n    RewriteEngine On\n    RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} transport=websocket [NC]\n    RewriteCond %{HTTP:Upgrade} websocket [NC]\n    RewriteCond %{HTTP:Connection} upgrade [NC]\n    RewriteRule /(.*) ws://localhost:3000/_next/webpack-hmr/$1 [P,L]\n    ProxyPass ws://localhost:3000/_next/webpack-hmr retry=0 timeout=30\n    ProxyPassReverse ws://localhost:3000/_next/webpack-hmr\n </Location>\n</VirtualHost>\n```\n\nFor custom servers, such as `express`, you may need to use `app.all` to ensure the request is passed correctly, for example:\n\n```js\napp.all('/_next/webpack-hmr', (req, res) => {\n  nextjsRequestHandler(req, res)\n})\n```\n\n#### Webpack 4 support has been removed\n\nIf you are already using webpack 5 you can skip this section.\n\nNext.js has adopted webpack 5 as the default for compilation in Next.js 11. As communicated in the [webpack 5 upgrading documentation](/docs/messages/webpack5) Next.js 12 removes support for webpack 4.\n\nIf your application is still using webpack 4 using the opt-out flag, you will now see an error linking to the [webpack 5 upgrading documentation](/docs/messages/webpack5).\n\n#### `target` option deprecated\n\nIf you do not have `target` in `next.config.js` you can skip this section.\n\nThe target option has been deprecated in favor of built-in support for tracing what dependencies are needed to run a page.\n\nDuring `next build`, Next.js will automatically trace each page and its dependencies to determine all of the files that are needed for deploying a production version of your application.\n\nIf you are currently using the `target` option set to `serverless`, please read the [documentation on how to leverage the new output](/docs/pages/api-reference/next-config-js/output).\n"},{"path":"docs/03-pages/01-building-your-application/10-upgrading/10-version-9.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/03-pages/01-building-your-application/10-upgrading/10-version-9.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/upgrading/version-9","sha":"5b240059fef0ebbe17eaa5dcfe5ab8d399bae23d","size":6646,"content":"---\ntitle: Upgrading to Version 9\nnav_title: Version 9\ndescription: Upgrade your Next.js Application from Version 8 to Version 9.\n---\n\nTo upgrade to version 9, run the following command:\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nnpm i next@9\n```\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nyarn add next@9\n```\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\npnpm up next@9\n```\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nbun add next@9\n```\n\n> **Good to know:** If you are using TypeScript, ensure you also upgrade `@types/react` and `@types/react-dom` to their corresponding versions.\n\n## Production Deployment on Vercel\n\nIf you previously configured `routes` in your `vercel.json` file for dynamic routes, these rules can be removed when leveraging Next.js 9's new [Dynamic Routing feature](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes).\n\nNext.js 9's dynamic routes are **automatically configured on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)** and do not require any `vercel.json` customization.\n\nYou can read more about [Dynamic Routing here](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes).\n\n## Check your Custom App File (`pages/_app.js`)\n\nIf you previously copied the [Custom `<App>`](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/custom-app) example, you may be able to remove your `getInitialProps`.\n\nRemoving `getInitialProps` from `pages/_app.js` (when possible) is important to leverage new Next.js features!\n\nThe following `getInitialProps` does nothing and may be removed:\n\n```js\nclass MyApp extends App {\n  // Remove me, I do nothing!\n  static async getInitialProps({ Component, ctx }) {\n    let pageProps = {}\n\n    if (Component.getInitialProps) {\n      pageProps = await Component.getInitialProps(ctx)\n    }\n\n    return { pageProps }\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    // ... etc\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Breaking Changes\n\n### `@zeit/next-typescript` is no longer necessary\n\nNext.js will now ignore usage `@zeit/next-typescript` and warn you to remove it. Please remove this plugin from your `next.config.js`.\n\nRemove references to `@zeit/next-typescript/babel` from your custom `.babelrc` (if present).\n\nThe usage of [`fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin`](https://github.com/Realytics/fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin/issues) should also be removed from your `next.config.js`.\n\nTypeScript Definitions are published with the `next` package, so you need to uninstall `@types/next` as they would conflict.\n\nThe following types are different:\n\n> This list was created by the community to help you upgrade, if you find other differences please send a pull-request to this list to help other users.\n\nFrom:\n\n```tsx\nimport { NextContext } from 'next'\nimport { NextAppContext, DefaultAppIProps } from 'next/app'\nimport { NextDocumentContext, DefaultDocumentIProps } from 'next/document'\n```\n\nto\n\n```tsx\nimport { NextPageContext } from 'next'\nimport { AppContext, AppInitialProps } from 'next/app'\nimport { DocumentContext, DocumentInitialProps } from 'next/document'\n```\n\n### The `config` key is now an export on a page\n\nYou may no longer export a custom variable named `config` from a page (i.e. `export { config }` / `export const config ...`).\nThis exported variable is now used to specify page-level Next.js configuration like Opt-in AMP and API Route features.\n\nYou must rename a non-Next.js-purposed `config` export to something different.\n\n### `next/dynamic` no longer renders \"loading...\" by default while loading\n\nDynamic components will not render anything by default while loading. You can still customize this behavior by setting the `loading` property:\n\n```jsx\nimport dynamic from 'next/dynamic'\n\nconst DynamicComponentWithCustomLoading = dynamic(\n  () => import('../components/hello2'),\n  {\n    loading: () => <p>Loading</p>,\n  }\n)\n```\n\n### `withAmp` has been removed in favor of an exported configuration object\n\nNext.js now has the concept of page-level configuration, so the `withAmp` higher-order component has been removed for consistency.\n\nThis change can be **automatically migrated by running the following commands in the root of your Next.js project:**\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\ncurl -L https://github.com/vercel/next-codemod/archive/master.tar.gz | tar -xz --strip=2 next-codemod-master/transforms/withamp-to-config.js npx jscodeshift -t ./withamp-to-config.js pages/**/*.js\n```\n\nTo perform this migration by hand, or view what the codemod will produce, see below:\n\n**Before**\n\n```jsx\nimport { withAmp } from 'next/amp'\n\nfunction Home() {\n  return <h1>My AMP Page</h1>\n}\n\nexport default withAmp(Home)\n// or\nexport default withAmp(Home, { hybrid: true })\n```\n\n**After**\n\n```jsx\nexport default function Home() {\n  return <h1>My AMP Page</h1>\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  amp: true,\n  // or\n  amp: 'hybrid',\n}\n```\n\n### `next export` no longer exports pages as `index.html`\n\nPreviously, exporting `pages/about.js` would result in `out/about/index.html`. This behavior has been changed to result in `out/about.html`.\n\nYou can revert to the previous behavior by creating a `next.config.js` with the following content:\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  trailingSlash: true,\n}\n```\n\n### `pages/api/` is treated differently\n\nPages in `pages/api/` are now considered [API Routes](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-9#api-routes).\nPages in this directory will no longer contain a client-side bundle.\n\n## Deprecated Features\n\n### `next/dynamic` has deprecated loading multiple modules at once\n\nThe ability to load multiple modules at once has been deprecated in `next/dynamic` to be closer to React's implementation (`React.lazy` and `Suspense`).\n\nUpdating code that relies on this behavior is relatively straightforward! We've provided an example of a before/after to help you migrate your application:\n\n**Before**\n\n```jsx\nimport dynamic from 'next/dynamic'\n\nconst HelloBundle = dynamic({\n  modules: () => {\n    const components = {\n      Hello1: () => import('../components/hello1').then((m) => m.default),\n      Hello2: () => import('../components/hello2').then((m) => m.default),\n    }\n\n    return components\n  },\n  render: (props, { Hello1, Hello2 }) => (\n    <div>\n      <h1>{props.title}</h1>\n      <Hello1 />\n      <Hello2 />\n    </div>\n  ),\n})\n\nfunction DynamicBundle() {\n  return <HelloBundle title=\"Dynamic Bundle\" />\n}\n\nexport default DynamicBundle\n```\n\n**After**\n\n```jsx\nimport dynamic from 'next/dynamic'\n\nconst Hello1 = dynamic(() => import('../components/hello1'))\nconst Hello2 = dynamic(() => import('../components/hello2'))\n\nfunction HelloBundle({ title }) {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>{title}</h1>\n      <Hello1 />\n      <Hello2 />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nfunction DynamicBundle() {\n  return <HelloBundle title=\"Dynamic Bundle\" />\n}\n\nexport default DynamicBundle\n```\n"},{"path":"docs/03-pages/01-building-your-application/01-routing/06-custom-document.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/03-pages/01-building-your-application/01-routing/06-custom-document.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/custom-document","sha":"f58161c3a6250836b2618804c4b2244ff4c63f82","size":4941,"content":"---\ntitle: Custom Document\ndescription: Extend the default document markup added by Next.js.\n---\n\nA custom `Document` can update the `<html>` and `<body>` tags used to render a [Page](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts).\n\nTo override the default `Document`, create the file `pages/_document` as shown below:\n\n```tsx filename=\"pages/_document.tsx\" switcher\nimport { Html, Head, Main, NextScript } from 'next/document'\n\nexport default function Document() {\n  return (\n    <Html lang=\"en\">\n      <Head />\n      <body>\n        <Main />\n        <NextScript />\n      </body>\n    </Html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"pages/_document.jsx\" switcher\nimport { Html, Head, Main, NextScript } from 'next/document'\n\nexport default function Document() {\n  return (\n    <Html lang=\"en\">\n      <Head />\n      <body>\n        <Main />\n        <NextScript />\n      </body>\n    </Html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know**\n>\n> - `_document` is only rendered on the server, so event handlers like `onClick` cannot be used in this file.\n> - `<Html>`, `<Head />`, `<Main />` and `<NextScript />` are required for the page to be properly rendered.\n\n## Caveats\n\n- The `<Head />` component used in `_document` is not the same as [`next/head`](/docs/pages/api-reference/components/head). The `<Head />` component used here should only be used for any `<head>` code that is common for all pages. For all other cases, such as `<title>` tags, we recommend using [`next/head`](/docs/pages/api-reference/components/head) in your pages or components.\n- React components outside of `<Main />` will not be initialized by the browser. Do _not_ add application logic here or custom CSS (like `styled-jsx`). If you need shared components in all your pages (like a menu or a toolbar), read [Layouts](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts#layout-pattern) instead.\n- `Document` currently does not support Next.js [Data Fetching methods](/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching) like [`getStaticProps`](/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-static-props) or [`getServerSideProps`](/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-server-side-props).\n\n## Customizing `renderPage`\n\nCustomizing `renderPage` is advanced and only needed for libraries like CSS-in-JS to support server-side rendering. This is not needed for built-in `styled-jsx` support.\n\n**We do not recommend using this pattern.** Instead, consider [incrementally adopting](/docs/app/building-your-application/upgrading/app-router-migration) the App Router, which allows you to more easily fetch data for [pages and layouts](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/layouts-and-templates).\n\n```tsx filename=\"pages/_document.tsx\" switcher\nimport Document, {\n  Html,\n  Head,\n  Main,\n  NextScript,\n  DocumentContext,\n  DocumentInitialProps,\n} from 'next/document'\n\nclass MyDocument extends Document {\n  static async getInitialProps(\n    ctx: DocumentContext\n  ): Promise<DocumentInitialProps> {\n    const originalRenderPage = ctx.renderPage\n\n    // Run the React rendering logic synchronously\n    ctx.renderPage = () =>\n      originalRenderPage({\n        // Useful for wrapping the whole react tree\n        enhanceApp: (App) => App,\n        // Useful for wrapping in a per-page basis\n        enhanceComponent: (Component) => Component,\n      })\n\n    // Run the parent `getInitialProps`, it now includes the custom `renderPage`\n    const initialProps = await Document.getInitialProps(ctx)\n\n    return initialProps\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <Html lang=\"en\">\n        <Head />\n        <body>\n          <Main />\n          <NextScript />\n        </body>\n      </Html>\n    )\n  }\n}\n\nexport default MyDocument\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"pages/_document.jsx\" switcher\nimport Document, { Html, Head, Main, NextScript } from 'next/document'\n\nclass MyDocument extends Document {\n  static async getInitialProps(ctx) {\n    const originalRenderPage = ctx.renderPage\n\n    // Run the React rendering logic synchronously\n    ctx.renderPage = () =>\n      originalRenderPage({\n        // Useful for wrapping the whole react tree\n        enhanceApp: (App) => App,\n        // Useful for wrapping in a per-page basis\n        enhanceComponent: (Component) => Component,\n      })\n\n    // Run the parent `getInitialProps`, it now includes the custom `renderPage`\n    const initialProps = await Document.getInitialProps(ctx)\n\n    return initialProps\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <Html lang=\"en\">\n        <Head />\n        <body>\n          <Main />\n          <NextScript />\n        </body>\n      </Html>\n    )\n  }\n}\n\nexport default MyDocument\n```\n\n> **Good to know**\n>\n> - `getInitialProps` in `_document` is not called during client-side transitions.\n> - The `ctx` object for `_document` is equivalent to the one received in [`getInitialProps`](/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/get-initial-props#context-object), with the addition of `renderPage`.\n"},{"path":"docs/03-pages/01-building-your-application/01-routing/01-pages-and-layouts.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/03-pages/01-building-your-application/01-routing/01-pages-and-layouts.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts","sha":"933f0bf4988db51dbc9a1e6d09cb55d2f306a591","size":6820,"content":"---\ntitle: Pages and Layouts\ndescription: Create your first page and shared layout with the Pages Router.\n---\n\nThe Pages Router has a file-system based router built on the concept of pages.\n\nWhen a file is added to the `pages` directory, it's automatically available as a route.\n\nIn Next.js, a **page** is a [React Component](https://react.dev/learn/your-first-component) exported from a `.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, or `.tsx` file in the `pages` directory. Each page is associated with a route based on its file name.\n\n**Example**: If you create `pages/about.js` that exports a React component like below, it will be accessible at `/about`.\n\n```jsx\nexport default function About() {\n  return <div>About</div>\n}\n```\n\n## Index routes\n\nThe router will automatically route files named `index` to the root of the directory.\n\n- `pages/index.js` → `/`\n- `pages/blog/index.js` → `/blog`\n\n## Nested routes\n\nThe router supports nested files. If you create a nested folder structure, files will automatically be routed in the same way still.\n\n- `pages/blog/first-post.js` → `/blog/first-post`\n- `pages/dashboard/settings/username.js` → `/dashboard/settings/username`\n\n## Pages with Dynamic Routes\n\nNext.js supports pages with dynamic routes. For example, if you create a file called `pages/posts/[id].js`, then it will be accessible at `posts/1`, `posts/2`, etc.\n\n> To learn more about dynamic routing, check the [Dynamic Routing documentation](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes).\n\n## Layout Pattern\n\nThe React model allows us to deconstruct a [page](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts) into a series of components. Many of these components are often reused between pages. For example, you might have the same navigation bar and footer on every page.\n\n```jsx filename=\"components/layout.js\"\nimport Navbar from './navbar'\nimport Footer from './footer'\n\nexport default function Layout({ children }) {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Navbar />\n      <main>{children}</main>\n      <Footer />\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n## Examples\n\n### Single Shared Layout with Custom App\n\nIf you only have one layout for your entire application, you can create a [Custom App](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/custom-app) and wrap your application with the layout. Since the `<Layout />` component is re-used when changing pages, its component state will be preserved (e.g. input values).\n\n```jsx filename=\"pages/_app.js\"\nimport Layout from '../components/layout'\n\nexport default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {\n  return (\n    <Layout>\n      <Component {...pageProps} />\n    </Layout>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### Per-Page Layouts\n\nIf you need multiple layouts, you can add a property `getLayout` to your page, allowing you to return a React component for the layout. This allows you to define the layout on a _per-page basis_. Since we're returning a function, we can have complex nested layouts if desired.\n\n```jsx filename=\"pages/index.js\"\n\nimport Layout from '../components/layout'\nimport NestedLayout from '../components/nested-layout'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    /** Your content */\n  )\n}\n\nPage.getLayout = function getLayout(page) {\n  return (\n    <Layout>\n      <NestedLayout>{page}</NestedLayout>\n    </Layout>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"pages/_app.js\"\nexport default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {\n  // Use the layout defined at the page level, if available\n  const getLayout = Component.getLayout ?? ((page) => page)\n\n  return getLayout(<Component {...pageProps} />)\n}\n```\n\nWhen navigating between pages, we want to _persist_ page state (input values, scroll position, etc.) for a Single-Page Application (SPA) experience.\n\nThis layout pattern enables state persistence because the React component tree is maintained between page transitions. With the component tree, React can understand which elements have changed to preserve state.\n\n> **Good to know**: This process is called [reconciliation](https://react.dev/learn/preserving-and-resetting-state), which is how React understands which elements have changed.\n\n### With TypeScript\n\nWhen using TypeScript, you must first create a new type for your pages which includes a `getLayout` function. Then, you must create a new type for your `AppProps` which overrides the `Component` property to use the previously created type.\n\n```tsx filename=\"pages/index.tsx\" switcher\nimport type { ReactElement } from 'react'\nimport Layout from '../components/layout'\nimport NestedLayout from '../components/nested-layout'\nimport type { NextPageWithLayout } from './_app'\n\nconst Page: NextPageWithLayout = () => {\n  return <p>hello world</p>\n}\n\nPage.getLayout = function getLayout(page: ReactElement) {\n  return (\n    <Layout>\n      <NestedLayout>{page}</NestedLayout>\n    </Layout>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default Page\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"pages/index.js\" switcher\nimport Layout from '../components/layout'\nimport NestedLayout from '../components/nested-layout'\n\nconst Page = () => {\n  return <p>hello world</p>\n}\n\nPage.getLayout = function getLayout(page) {\n  return (\n    <Layout>\n      <NestedLayout>{page}</NestedLayout>\n    </Layout>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default Page\n```\n\n```tsx filename=\"pages/_app.tsx\" switcher\nimport type { ReactElement, ReactNode } from 'react'\nimport type { NextPage } from 'next'\nimport type { AppProps } from 'next/app'\n\nexport type NextPageWithLayout<P = {}, IP = P> = NextPage<P, IP> & {\n  getLayout?: (page: ReactElement) => ReactNode\n}\n\ntype AppPropsWithLayout = AppProps & {\n  Component: NextPageWithLayout\n}\n\nexport default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppPropsWithLayout) {\n  // Use the layout defined at the page level, if available\n  const getLayout = Component.getLayout ?? ((page) => page)\n\n  return getLayout(<Component {...pageProps} />)\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"pages/_app.js\" switcher\nexport default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {\n  // Use the layout defined at the page level, if available\n  const getLayout = Component.getLayout ?? ((page) => page)\n\n  return getLayout(<Component {...pageProps} />)\n}\n```\n\n### Data Fetching\n\nInside your layout, you can fetch data on the client-side using `useEffect` or a library like [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/).

Server-rendering an error page for every visit increases the load of the Next.js server. This can result in increased costs and slow experiences.\n\nTo avoid the above pitfalls, Next.js provides a static 404 page by default without having to add any additional files.\n\n### Customizing The 404 Page\n\nTo create a custom 404 page you can create a `pages/404.js` file.

To help users get responses to errors as fast as possible, Next.js provides a static 500 page by default without having to add any additional files.\n\n### Customizing The 500 Page\n\nTo customize the 500 page you can create a `pages/500.js` file. This file is statically generated at build time.\n\n```jsx filename=\"pages/500.js\"\nexport default function Custom500() {\n  return <h1>500 - Server-side error occurred</h1>\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know**: You can use [`getStaticProps`](/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-static-props) inside this page if you need to fetch data at build time.\n\n### More Advanced Error Page Customizing\n\n500 errors are handled both client-side and server-side by the `Error` component. If you wish to override it, define the file `pages/_error.js` and add the following code:\n\n```jsx\nfunction Error({ statusCode }) {\n  return (\n    <p>\n      {statusCode\n        ? `An error ${statusCode} occurred on server`\n        : 'An error occurred on client'}\n    </p>\n  )\n}\n\nError.getInitialProps = ({ res, err }) => {\n  const statusCode = res ? res.statusCode : err ? err.statusCode : 404\n  return { statusCode }\n}\n\nexport default Error\n```\n\n> `pages/_error.js` is only used in production. In development you’ll get an error with the call stack to know where the error originated from.\n\n### Reusing the built-in error page\n\nIf you want to render the built-in error page you can by importing the `Error` component:\n\n```jsx\nimport Error from 'next/error'\n\nexport async function getServerSideProps() {\n  const res = await fetch('https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js')\n  const errorCode = res.ok ? false : res.status\n  const json = await res.json()\n\n  return {\n    props: { errorCode, stars: json.stargazers_count },\n  }\n}\n\nexport default function Page({ errorCode, stars }) {\n  if (errorCode) {\n    return <Error statusCode={errorCode} />\n  }\n\n  return <div>Next stars: {stars}</div>\n}\n```\n\nThe `Error` component also takes `title` as a property if you want to pass in a text message along with a `statusCode`.\n\nIf you have a custom `Error` component be sure to import that one instead. `next/error` exports the default component used by Next.js.\n\n### Caveats\n\n- `Error` does not currently support Next.js [Data Fetching methods](/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching) like [`getStaticProps`](/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-static-props) or [`getServerSideProps`](/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-server-side-props).\n- `_error`, like `_app`, is a reserved pathname. `_error` is used to define the customized layouts and behaviors of the error pages. `/_error` will render 404 when accessed directly via [routing](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing) or rendering in a [custom server](/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/custom-server).\n"},{"path":"docs/03-pages/01-building-your-application/01-routing/02-dynamic-routes.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/03-pages/01-building-your-application/01-routing/02-dynamic-routes.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes","sha":"50dde821c6ef780e5ac5a550090cd9afe9681aca","size":3172,"content":"---\ntitle: Dynamic Routes\ndescription: Dynamic Routes are pages that allow you to add custom params to your URLs.

For example, `[id]` or `[slug]`.\n\nDynamic Segments can be accessed from [`useRouter`](/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/use-router).\n\n## Example\n\nFor example, a blog could include the following route `pages/blog/[slug].js` where `[slug]` is the Dynamic Segment for blog posts.\n\n```jsx\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/router'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  const router = useRouter()\n  return <p>Post: {router.query.slug}</p>\n}\n```\n\n| Route                  | Example URL | `params`        |\n| ---------------------- | ----------- | --------------- |\n| `pages/blog/[slug].js` | `/blog/a`   | `{ slug: 'a' }` |\n| `pages/blog/[slug].js` | `/blog/b`   | `{ slug: 'b' }` |\n| `pages/blog/[slug].js` | `/blog/c`   | `{ slug: 'c' }` |\n\n## Catch-all Segments\n\nDynamic Segments can be extended to **catch-all** subsequent segments by adding an ellipsis inside the brackets `[...segmentName]`.\n\nFor example, `pages/shop/[...slug].js` will match `/shop/clothes`, but also `/shop/clothes/tops`, `/shop/clothes/tops/t-shirts`, and so on.\n\n| Route                     | Example URL   | `params`                    |\n| ------------------------- | ------------- | --------------------------- |\n| `pages/shop/[...slug].js` | `/shop/a`     | `{ slug: ['a'] }`           |\n| `pages/shop/[...slug].js` | `/shop/a/b`   | `{ slug: ['a', 'b'] }`      |\n| `pages/shop/[...slug].js` | `/shop/a/b/c` | `{ slug: ['a', 'b', 'c'] }` |\n\n## Optional Catch-all Segments\n\nCatch-all Segments can be made **optional** by including the parameter in double square brackets: `[[...segmentName]]`.\n\nFor example, `pages/shop/[[...slug]].js` will **also** match `/shop`, in addition to `/shop/clothes`, `/shop/clothes/tops`, `/shop/clothes/tops/t-shirts`.\n\nThe difference between **catch-all** and **optional catch-all** segments is that with optional, the route without the parameter is also matched (`/shop` in the example above).\n\n| Route                       | Example URL   | `params`                    |\n| --------------------------- | ------------- | --------------------------- |\n| `pages/shop/[[...slug]].js` | `/shop`       | `{ slug: undefined }`       |\n| `pages/shop/[[...slug]].js` | `/shop/a`     | `{ slug: ['a'] }`           |\n| `pages/shop/[[...slug]].js` | `/shop/a/b`   | `{ slug: ['a', 'b'] }`      |\n| `pages/shop/[[...slug]].js` | `/shop/a/b/c` | `{ slug: ['a', 'b', 'c'] }` |\n"},{"path":"docs/03-pages/01-building-your-application/01-routing/04-redirecting.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/03-pages/01-building-your-application/01-routing/04-redirecting.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/redirecting","sha":"f2330b80fc89cd9e7c86af851c8c05cfb2c862b3","size":484,"content":"---\ntitle: Redirecting\ndescription: Learn the different ways to handle redirects in Next.js.\nsource: app/building-your-application/routing/redirecting\n---\n\n{/* DO NOT EDIT.

Each one maps a path (`href`) to a known page:\n\n- `/` → `pages/index.js`\n- `/about` → `pages/about.js`\n- `/blog/hello-world` → `pages/blog/[slug].js`\n\nAny `<Link />` in the viewport (initially or through scroll) will be prefetched by default (including the corresponding data) for pages using [Static Generation](/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-static-props). The corresponding data for [server-rendered](/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-server-side-props) routes is fetched _only when_ the `<Link />` is clicked.\n\n## Linking to dynamic paths\n\nYou can also use interpolation to create the path, which comes in handy for [dynamic route segments](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes). For example, to show a list of posts which have been passed to the component as a prop:\n\n```jsx\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n\nfunction Posts({ posts }) {\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {posts.map((post) => (\n        <li key={post.id}>\n          <Link href={`/blog/${encodeURIComponent(post.slug)}`}>\n            {post.title}\n          </Link>\n        </li>\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default Posts\n```\n\n> [`encodeURIComponent`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/encodeURIComponent) is used in the example to keep the path utf-8 compatible.\n\nAlternatively, using a URL Object:\n\n```jsx\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n\nfunction Posts({ posts }) {\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {posts.map((post) => (\n        <li key={post.id}>\n          <Link\n            href={{\n              pathname: '/blog/[slug]',\n              query: { slug: post.slug },\n            }}\n          >\n            {post.title}\n          </Link>\n        </li>\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default Posts\n```\n\nNow, instead of using interpolation to create the path, we use a URL object in `href` where:\n\n- `pathname` is the name of the page in the `pages` directory. `/blog/[slug]` in this case.\n- `query` is an object with the dynamic segment. `slug` in this case.\n\n## Injecting the router\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Examples</summary>\n\n- [Dynamic Routing](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/dynamic-routing)\n\n</details>\n\nTo access the [`router` object](/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/use-router#router-object) in a React component you can use [`useRouter`](/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/use-router) or [`withRouter`](/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/use-router#withrouter).\n\nIn general we recommend using [`useRouter`](/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/use-router).\n\n## Imperative Routing\n\n[`next/link`](/docs/pages/api-reference/components/link) should be able to cover most of your routing needs, but you can also do client-side navigations without it, take a look at the [documentation for `next/router`](/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/use-router).\n\nThe following example shows how to do basic page navigations with [`useRouter`](/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/use-router):\n\n```jsx\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/router'\n\nexport default function ReadMore() {\n  const router = useRouter()\n\n  return (\n    <button onClick={() => router.push('/about')}>\n      Click here to read more\n    </button>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n## Shallow Routing\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Examples</summary>\n\n- [Shallow Routing](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-shallow-routing)\n\n</details>\n\nShallow routing allows you to change the URL without running data fetching methods again, that includes [`getServerSideProps`](/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-server-side-props), [`getStaticProps`](/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-static-props), and [`getInitialProps`](/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/get-initial-props).\n\nYou'll receive the updated `pathname` and the `query` via the [`router` object](/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/use-router#router-object) (added by [`useRouter`](/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/use-router) or [`withRouter`](/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/use-router#withrouter)), without losing state.\n\nTo enable shallow routing, set the `shallow` option to `true`. Consider the following example:\n\n```jsx\nimport { useEffect } from 'react'\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/router'\n\n// Current URL is '/'\nfunction Page() {\n  const router = useRouter()\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    // Always do navigations after the first render\n    router.push('/?counter=10', undefined, { shallow: true })\n  }, [])\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    // The counter changed!\n  }, [router.query.counter])\n}\n\nexport default Page\n```\n\nThe URL will get updated to `/?counter=10` and the page won't get replaced, only the state of the route is changed.\n\nYou can also watch for URL changes via [`componentDidUpdate`](https://react.dev/reference/react/Component#componentdidupdate) as shown below:\n\n```jsx\ncomponentDidUpdate(prevProps) {\n  const { pathname, query } = this.props.router\n  // verify props have changed to avoid an infinite loop\n  if (query.counter !== prevProps.router.query.counter) {\n    // fetch data based on the new query\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Caveats\n\nShallow routing **only** works for URL changes in the current page. For example, let's assume we have another page called `pages/about.js`, and you run this:\n\n```js\nrouter.push('/?counter=10', '/about?counter=10', { shallow: true })\n```\n\nSince that's a new page, it'll unload the current page, load the new one and wait for data fetching even though we asked to do shallow routing.\n\nWhen shallow routing is used with middleware it will not ensure the new page matches the current page like previously done without middleware. This is due to middleware being able to rewrite dynamically and can't be verified client-side without a data fetch which is skipped with shallow, so a shallow route change must always be treated as shallow.\n"},{"path":"docs/03-pages/01-building-your-application/01-routing/07-api-routes.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/03-pages/01-building-your-application/01-routing/07-api-routes.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes","sha":"e31e09e1753813a7d5d97a9b4ecc5d18a0817966","size":15154,"content":"---\ntitle: API Routes\ndescription: Next.js supports API Routes, which allow you to build your API without leaving your Next.js app. Learn how it works here.\n---\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Examples</summary>\n\n- [Basic API Routes](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/api-routes)\n- [API Routes Request Helpers](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/api-routes-middleware)\n- [API Routes with GraphQL](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/api-routes-graphql)\n- [API Routes with REST](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/api-routes-rest)\n- [API Routes with CORS](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/api-routes-cors)\n\n</details>\n\n> **Good to know**: If you are using the App Router, you can use [Server Components](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components) or [Route Handlers](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-handlers) instead of API Routes.\n\nAPI routes provide a solution to build a **public API** with Next.js.\n\nAny file inside the folder `pages/api` is mapped to `/api/*` and will be treated as an API endpoint instead of a `page`.

You can customize such behavior by wrapping the request handler with the [CORS request helpers](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/api-routes-cors).\n\n- API Routes can't be used with [static exports](/docs/pages/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports). However, [Route Handlers](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-handlers) in the App Router can.\n  > - API Routes will be affected by [`pageExtensions` configuration](/docs/pages/api-reference/next-config-js/pageExtensions) in `next.config.js`.\n\n## Parameters\n\n```tsx\nexport default function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n- `req`: An instance of [http.IncomingMessage](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#class-httpincomingmessage)\n- `res`: An instance of [http.ServerResponse](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#class-httpserverresponse)\n\n## HTTP Methods\n\nTo handle different HTTP methods in an API route, you can use `req.method` in your request handler, like so:\n\n```ts filename=\"pages/api/hello.ts\" switcher\nimport type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next'\n\nexport default function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {\n  if (req.method === 'POST') {\n    // Process a POST request\n  } else {\n    // Handle any other HTTP method\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"pages/api/hello.js\" switcher\nexport default function handler(req, res) {\n  if (req.method === 'POST') {\n    // Process a POST request\n  } else {\n    // Handle any other HTTP method\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Request Helpers\n\nAPI Routes provide built-in request helpers which parse the incoming request (`req`):\n\n- `req.cookies` - An object containing the cookies sent by the request. Defaults to `{}`\n- `req.query` - An object containing the [query string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string). Defaults to `{}`\n- `req.body` - An object containing the body parsed by `content-type`, or `null` if no body was sent\n\n### Custom config\n\nEvery API Route can export a `config` object to change the default configuration, which is the following:\n\n```js\nexport const config = {\n  api: {\n    bodyParser: {\n      sizeLimit: '1mb',\n    },\n  },\n  // Specifies the maximum allowed duration for this function to execute (in seconds)\n  maxDuration: 5,\n}\n```\n\n`bodyParser` is automatically enabled. If you want to consume the body as a `Stream` or with [`raw-body`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/raw-body), you can set this to `false`.\n\nOne use case for disabling the automatic `bodyParsing` is to allow you to verify the raw body of a **webhook** request, for example [from GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/securing-your-webhooks#validating-payloads-from-github).\n\n```js\nexport const config = {\n  api: {\n    bodyParser: false,\n  },\n}\n```\n\n`bodyParser.sizeLimit` is the maximum size allowed for the parsed body, in any format supported by [bytes](https://github.com/visionmedia/bytes.js), like so:\n\n```js\nexport const config = {\n  api: {\n    bodyParser: {\n      sizeLimit: '500kb',\n    },\n  },\n}\n```\n\n`externalResolver` is an explicit flag that tells the server that this route is being handled by an external resolver like _express_ or _connect_. Enabling this option disables warnings for unresolved requests.\n\n```js\nexport const config = {\n  api: {\n    externalResolver: true,\n  },\n}\n```\n\n`responseLimit` is automatically enabled, warning when an API Routes' response body is over 4MB.\n\nIf you are not using Next.js in a serverless environment, and understand the performance implications of not using a CDN or dedicated media host, you can set this limit to `false`.\n\n```js\nexport const config = {\n  api: {\n    responseLimit: false,\n  },\n}\n```\n\n`responseLimit` can also take the number of bytes or any string format supported by `bytes`, for example `1000`, `'500kb'` or `'3mb'`.\nThis value will be the maximum response size before a warning is displayed. Default is 4MB. (see above)\n\n```js\nexport const config = {\n  api: {\n    responseLimit: '8mb',\n  },\n}\n```\n\n## Response Helpers\n\nThe [Server Response object](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_serverresponse), (often abbreviated as `res`) includes a set of Express.js-like helper methods to improve the developer experience and increase the speed of creating new API endpoints.\n\nThe included helpers are:\n\n- `res.status(code)` - A function to set the status code. `code` must be a valid [HTTP status code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes)\n- `res.json(body)` - Sends a JSON response. `body` must be a [serializable object](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Glossary/Serialization)\n- `res.send(body)` - Sends the HTTP response. `body` can be a `string`, an `object` or a `Buffer`\n- `res.redirect([status,] path)` - Redirects to a specified path or URL. `status` must be a valid [HTTP status code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes). If not specified, `status` defaults to \"307\" \"Temporary redirect\".\n- `res.revalidate(urlPath)` - [Revalidate a page on demand](/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/incremental-static-regeneration#on-demand-revalidation) using `getStaticProps`. `urlPath` must be a `string`.\n\n### Setting the status code of a response\n\nWhen sending a response back to the client, you can set the status code of the response.\n\nThe following example sets the status code of the response to `200` (`OK`) and returns a `message` property with the value of `Hello from Next.js!` as a JSON response:\n\n```ts filename=\"pages/api/hello.ts\" switcher\nimport type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next'\n\ntype ResponseData = {\n  message: string\n}\n\nexport default function handler(\n  req: NextApiRequest,\n  res: NextApiResponse<ResponseData>\n) {\n  res.status(200).json({ message: 'Hello from Next.js!' })\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"pages/api/hello.js\" switcher\nexport default function handler(req, res) {\n  res.status(200).json({ message: 'Hello from Next.js!' })\n}\n```\n\n### Sending a JSON response\n\nWhen sending a response back to the client you can send a JSON response, this must be a [serializable object](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Glossary/Serialization).\nIn a real world application you might want to let the client know the status of the request depending on the result of the requested endpoint.\n\nThe following example sends a JSON response with the status code `200` (`OK`) and the result of the async operation. It's contained in a try catch block to handle any errors that may occur, with the appropriate status code and error message caught and sent back to the client:\n\n```ts filename=\"pages/api/hello.ts\" switcher\nimport type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next'\n\nexport default async function handler(\n  req: NextApiRequest,\n  res: NextApiResponse\n) {\n  try {\n    const result = await someAsyncOperation()\n    res.status(200).json({ result })\n  } catch (err) {\n    res.status(500).json({ error: 'failed to load data' })\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"pages/api/hello.js\" switcher\nexport default async function handler(req, res) {\n  try {\n    const result = await someAsyncOperation()\n    res.status(200).json({ result })\n  } catch (err) {\n    res.status(500).json({ error: 'failed to load data' })\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Sending a HTTP response\n\nSending an HTTP response works the same way as when sending a JSON response. The only difference is that the response body can be a `string`, an `object` or a `Buffer`.\n\nThe following example sends a HTTP response with the status code `200` (`OK`) and the result of the async operation.\n\n```ts filename=\"pages/api/hello.ts\" switcher\nimport type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next'\n\nexport default async function handler(\n  req: NextApiRequest,\n  res: NextApiResponse\n) {\n  try {\n    const result = await someAsyncOperation()\n    res.status(200).send({ result })\n  } catch (err) {\n    res.status(500).send({ error: 'failed to fetch data' })\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"pages/api/hello.js\" switcher\nexport default async function handler(req, res) {\n  try {\n    const result = await someAsyncOperation()\n    res.status(200).send({ result })\n  } catch (err) {\n    res.status(500).send({ error: 'failed to fetch data' })\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Redirects to a specified path or URL\n\nTaking a form as an example, you may want to redirect your client to a specified path or URL once they have submitted the form.\n\nThe following example redirects the client to the `/` path if the form is successfully submitted:\n\n```ts filename=\"pages/api/hello.ts\" switcher\nimport type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next'\n\nexport default async function handler(\n  req: NextApiRequest,\n  res: NextApiResponse\n) {\n  const { name, message } = req.body\n\n  try {\n    await handleFormInputAsync({ name, message })\n    res.redirect(307, '/')\n  } catch (err) {\n    res.status(500).send({ error: 'Failed to fetch data' })\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"pages/api/hello.js\" switcher\nexport default async function handler(req, res) {\n  const { name, message } = req.body\n\n  try {\n    await handleFormInputAsync({ name, message })\n    res.redirect(307, '/')\n  } catch (err) {\n    res.status(500).send({ error: 'failed to fetch data' })\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Adding TypeScript types\n\nYou can make your API Routes more type-safe by importing the `NextApiRequest` and `NextApiResponse` types from `next`, in addition to those, you can also type your response data:\n\n```ts\nimport type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next'\n\ntype ResponseData = {\n  message: string\n}\n\nexport default function handler(\n  req: NextApiRequest,\n  res: NextApiResponse<ResponseData>\n) {\n  res.status(200).json({ message: 'Hello from Next.js!' })\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know**: The body of `NextApiRequest` is `any` because the client may include any payload. You should validate the type/shape of the body at runtime before using it.\n\n## Dynamic API Routes\n\nAPI Routes support [dynamic routes](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes), and follow the same file naming rules used for `pages/`.\n\n```ts filename=\"pages/api/post/[pid].ts\" switcher\nimport type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next'\n\nexport default function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {\n  const { pid } = req.query\n  res.end(`Post: ${pid}`)\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"pages/api/post/[pid].js\" switcher\nexport default function handler(req, res) {\n  const { pid } = req.query\n  res.end(`Post: ${pid}`)\n}\n```\n\nNow, a request to `/api/post/abc` will respond with the text: `Post: abc`.\n\n### Catch all API routes\n\nAPI Routes can be extended to catch all paths by adding three dots (`...`) inside the brackets. For example:\n\n- `pages/api/post/[...slug].js` matches `/api/post/a`, but also `/api/post/a/b`, `/api/post/a/b/c` and so on.\n\n> **Good to know**: You can use names other than `slug`, such as: `[...param]`\n\nMatched parameters will be sent as a query parameter (`slug` in the example) to the page, and it will always be an array, so, the path `/api/post/a` will have the following `query` object:\n\n```json\n{ \"slug\": [\"a\"] }\n```\n\nAnd in the case of `/api/post/a/b`, and any other matching path, new parameters will be added to the array, like so:\n\n```json\n{ \"slug\": [\"a\", \"b\"] }\n```\n\nFor example:\n\n```ts filename=\"pages/api/post/[...slug].ts\" switcher\nimport type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next'\n\nexport default function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {\n  const { slug } = req.query\n  res.end(`Post: ${slug.join(', ')}`)\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"pages/api/post/[...slug].js\" switcher\nexport default function handler(req, res) {\n  const { slug } = req.query\n  res.end(`Post: ${slug.join(', ')}`)\n}\n```\n\nNow, a request to `/api/post/a/b/c` will respond with the text: `Post: a, b, c`.\n\n### Optional catch all API routes\n\nCatch all routes can be made optional by including the parameter in double brackets (`[[...slug]]`).\n\nFor example, `pages/api/post/[[...slug]].js` will match `/api/post`, `/api/post/a`, `/api/post/a/b`, and so on.\n\nThe main difference between catch all and optional catch all routes is that with optional, the route without the parameter is also matched (`/api/post` in the example above).\n\nThe `query` objects are as follows:\n\n```json\n{ } // GET `/api/post` (empty object)\n{ \"slug\": [\"a\"] } // `GET /api/post/a` (single-element array)\n{ \"slug\": [\"a\", \"b\"] } // `GET /api/post/a/b` (multi-element array)\n```\n\n### Caveats\n\n- Predefined API routes take precedence over dynamic API routes, and dynamic API routes over catch all API routes. Take a look at the following examples:\n  - `pages/api/post/create.js` - Will match `/api/post/create`\n  - `pages/api/post/[pid].js` - Will match `/api/post/1`, `/api/post/abc`, etc. But not `/api/post/create`\n  - `pages/api/post/[...slug].js` - Will match `/api/post/1/2`, `/api/post/a/b/c`, etc. But not `/api/post/create`, `/api/post/abc`\n\n## Edge API Routes\n\nIf you would like to use API Routes with the Edge Runtime, we recommend incrementally adopting the App Router and using [Route Handlers](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-handlers) instead.\n\nThe Route Handlers function signature is isomorphic, meaning you can use the same function for both Edge and Node.js runtimes.\n"},{"path":"docs/03-pages/01-building-your-application/01-routing/10-internationalization.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/03-pages/01-building-your-application/01-routing/10-internationalization.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/internationalization","sha":"b3b8cfeefe1366cb143644a71f2f9d97d2472729","size":14992,"content":"---\ntitle: Internationalization (i18n) Routing\nnav_title: Internationalization\ndescription: Next.js has built-in support for internationalized routing and language detection. Learn more here.\n---\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Examples</summary>\n\n- [i18n routing](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/i18n-routing)\n\n</details>\n\nNext.js has built-in support for internationalized ([i18n](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization#Naming)) routing since `v10.0.0`. You can provide a list of locales, the default locale, and domain-specific locales and Next.js will automatically handle the routing.\n\nThe i18n routing support is currently meant to complement existing i18n library solutions like [`react-intl`](https://formatjs.io/docs/getting-started/installation), [`react-i18next`](https://react.i18next.com/), [`lingui`](https://lingui.dev/), [`rosetta`](https://github.com/lukeed/rosetta), [`next-intl`](https://github.com/amannn/next-intl), [`next-translate`](https://github.com/aralroca/next-translate), [`next-multilingual`](https://github.com/Avansai/next-multilingual), [`tolgee`](https://tolgee.io/integrations/next), [`paraglide-next`](https://inlang.com/m/osslbuzt/paraglide-next-i18n) and others by streamlining the routes and locale parsing.\n\n## Getting started\n\nTo get started, add the `i18n` config to your `next.config.js` file.\n\nLocales are [UTS Locale Identifiers](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-59/tr35.html#Identifiers), a standardized format for defining locales.\n\nGenerally a Locale Identifier is made up of a language, region, and script separated by a dash: `language-region-script`. The region and script are optional. An example:\n\n- `en-US` - English as spoken in the United States\n- `nl-NL` - Dutch as spoken in the Netherlands\n- `nl` - Dutch, no specific region\n\nIf user locale is `nl-BE` and it is not listed in your configuration, they will be redirected to `nl` if available, or to the default locale otherwise.\nIf you don't plan to support all regions of a country, it is therefore a good practice to include country locales that will act as fallbacks.\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  i18n: {\n    // These are all the locales you want to support in\n    // your application\n    locales: ['en-US', 'fr', 'nl-NL'],\n    // This is the default locale you want to be used when visiting\n    // a non-locale prefixed path e.g. `/hello`\n    defaultLocale: 'en-US',\n    // This is a list of locale domains and the default locale they\n    // should handle (these are only required when setting up domain routing)\n    // Note: subdomains must be included in the domain value to be matched e.g. \"fr.example.com\".\n    domains: [\n      {\n        domain: 'example.com',\n        defaultLocale: 'en-US',\n      },\n      {\n        domain: 'example.nl',\n        defaultLocale: 'nl-NL',\n      },\n      {\n        domain: 'example.fr',\n        defaultLocale: 'fr',\n        // an optional http field can also be used to test\n        // locale domains locally with http instead of https\n        http: true,\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n}\n```\n\n## Locale Strategies\n\nThere are two locale handling strategies: Sub-path Routing and Domain Routing.\n\n### Sub-path Routing\n\nSub-path Routing puts the locale in the url path.\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  i18n: {\n    locales: ['en-US', 'fr', 'nl-NL'],\n    defaultLocale: 'en-US',\n  },\n}\n```\n\nWith the above configuration `en-US`, `fr`, and `nl-NL` will be available to be routed to, and `en-US` is the default locale. If you have a `pages/blog.js` the following urls would be available:\n\n- `/blog`\n- `/fr/blog`\n- `/nl-nl/blog`\n\nThe default locale does not have a prefix.\n\n### Domain Routing\n\nBy using domain routing you can configure locales to be served from different domains:\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  i18n: {\n    locales: ['en-US', 'fr', 'nl-NL', 'nl-BE'],\n    defaultLocale: 'en-US',\n\n    domains: [\n      {\n        // Note: subdomains must be included in the domain value to be matched\n        // e.g. www.example.com should be used if that is the expected hostname\n        domain: 'example.com',\n        defaultLocale: 'en-US',\n      },\n      {\n        domain: 'example.fr',\n        defaultLocale: 'fr',\n      },\n      {\n        domain: 'example.nl',\n        defaultLocale: 'nl-NL',\n        // specify other locales that should be redirected\n        // to this domain\n        locales: ['nl-BE'],\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n}\n```\n\nFor example if you have `pages/blog.js` the following urls will be available:\n\n- `example.com/blog`\n- `www.example.com/blog`\n- `example.fr/blog`\n- `example.nl/blog`\n- `example.nl/nl-BE/blog`\n\n## Automatic Locale Detection\n\nWhen a user visits the application root (generally `/`), Next.js will try to automatically detect which locale the user prefers based on the [`Accept-Language`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept-Language) header and the current domain.\n\nIf a locale other than the default locale is detected, the user will be redirected to either:\n\n- **When using Sub-path Routing:** The locale prefixed path\n- **When using Domain Routing:** The domain with that locale specified as the default\n\nWhen using Domain Routing, if a user with the `Accept-Language` header `fr;q=0.9` visits `example.com`, they will be redirected to `example.fr` since that domain handles the `fr` locale by default.\n\nWhen using Sub-path Routing, the user would be redirected to `/fr`.\n\n### Prefixing the Default Locale\n\nWith Next.js 12 and [Middleware](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/middleware), we can add a prefix to the default locale with a [workaround](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/18419).\n\nFor example, here's a `next.config.js` file with support for a few languages. Note the `\"default\"` locale has been added intentionally.\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  i18n: {\n    locales: ['default', 'en', 'de', 'fr'],\n    defaultLocale: 'default',\n    localeDetection: false,\n  },\n  trailingSlash: true,\n}\n```\n\nNext, we can use [Middleware](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/middleware) to add custom routing rules:\n\n```ts filename=\"middleware.ts\"\nimport { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n\nconst PUBLIC_FILE = /\\.(.*)$/\n\nexport async function middleware(req: NextRequest) {\n  if (\n    req.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/_next') ||\n    req.nextUrl.pathname.includes('/api/') ||\n    PUBLIC_FILE.test(req.nextUrl.pathname)\n  ) {\n    return\n  }\n\n  if (req.nextUrl.locale === 'default') {\n    const locale = req.cookies.get('NEXT_LOCALE')?.value || 'en'\n\n    return NextResponse.redirect(\n      new URL(`/${locale}${req.nextUrl.pathname}${req.nextUrl.search}`, req.url)\n    )\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis [Middleware](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/middleware) skips adding the default prefix to [API Routes](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) and [public](/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/static-assets) files like fonts or images. If a request is made to the default locale, we redirect to our prefix `/en`.\n\n### Disabling Automatic Locale Detection\n\nThe automatic locale detection can be disabled with:\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  i18n: {\n    localeDetection: false,\n  },\n}\n```\n\nWhen `localeDetection` is set to `false` Next.js will no longer automatically redirect based on the user's preferred locale and will only provide locale information detected from either the locale based domain or locale path as described above.\n\n## Accessing the locale information\n\nYou can access the locale information via the Next.js router. For example, using the [`useRouter()`](/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/use-router) hook the following properties are available:\n\n- `locale` contains the currently active locale.\n- `locales` contains all configured locales.\n- `defaultLocale` contains the configured default locale.\n\nWhen [pre-rendering](/docs/pages/building-your-application/rendering/static-site-generation) pages with `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps`, the locale information is provided in [the context](/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-static-props) provided to the function.\n\nWhen leveraging `getStaticPaths`, the configured locales are provided in the context parameter of the function under `locales` and the configured defaultLocale under `defaultLocale`.\n\n## Transition between locales\n\nYou can use `next/link` or `next/router` to transition between locales.\n\nFor `next/link`, a `locale` prop can be provided to transition to a different locale from the currently active one. If no `locale` prop is provided, the currently active `locale` is used during client-transitions. For example:\n\n```jsx\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n\nexport default function IndexPage(props) {\n  return (\n    <Link href=\"/another\" locale=\"fr\">\n      To /fr/another\n    </Link>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nWhen using the `next/router` methods directly, you can specify the `locale` that should be used via the transition options. For example:\n\n```jsx\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/router'\n\nexport default function IndexPage(props) {\n  const router = useRouter()\n\n  return (\n    <div\n      onClick={() => {\n        router.push('/another', '/another', { locale: 'fr' })\n      }}\n    >\n      to /fr/another\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nNote that to handle switching only the `locale` while preserving all routing information such as [dynamic route](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes) query values or hidden href query values, you can provide the `href` parameter as an object:\n\n```jsx\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/router'\nconst router = useRouter()\nconst { pathname, asPath, query } = router\n// change just the locale and maintain all other route information including href's query\nrouter.push({ pathname, query }, asPath, { locale: nextLocale })\n```\n\nSee [here](/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/use-router#with-url-object) for more information on the object structure for `router.push`.\n\nIf you have a `href` that already includes the locale you can opt-out of automatically handling the locale prefixing:\n\n```jsx\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n\nexport default function IndexPage(props) {\n  return (\n    <Link href=\"/fr/another\" locale={false}>\n      To /fr/another\n    </Link>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n## Leveraging the `NEXT_LOCALE` cookie\n\nNext.js allows setting a `NEXT_LOCALE=the-locale` cookie, which takes priority over the accept-language header. This cookie can be set using a language switcher and then when a user comes back to the site it will leverage the locale specified in the cookie when redirecting from `/` to the correct locale location.\n\nFor example, if a user prefers the locale `fr` in their accept-language header but a `NEXT_LOCALE=en` cookie is set the `en` locale when visiting `/` the user will be redirected to the `en` locale location until the cookie is removed or expired.\n\n## Search Engine Optimization\n\nSince Next.js knows what language the user is visiting it will automatically add the `lang` attribute to the `<html>` tag.\n\nNext.js doesn't know about variants of a page so it's up to you to add the `hreflang` meta tags using [`next/head`](/docs/pages/api-reference/components/head). You can learn more about `hreflang` in the [Google Webmasters documentation](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/189077).\n\n## How does this work with Static Generation?\n\n> Note that Internationalized Routing does not integrate with [`output: 'export'`](/docs/pages/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports) as it does not leverage the Next.js routing layer. Hybrid Next.js applications that do not use `output: 'export'` are fully supported.\n\n### Dynamic Routes and `getStaticProps` Pages\n\nFor pages using `getStaticProps` with [Dynamic Routes](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes), all locale variants of the page desired to be prerendered need to be returned from [`getStaticPaths`](/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-static-paths). Along with the `params` object returned for `paths`, you can also return a `locale` field specifying which locale you want to render. For example:\n\n```jsx filename=\"pages/blog/[slug].js\"\nexport const getStaticPaths = ({ locales }) => {\n  return {\n    paths: [\n      // if no `locale` is provided only the defaultLocale will be generated\n      { params: { slug: 'post-1' }, locale: 'en-US' },\n      { params: { slug: 'post-1' }, locale: 'fr' },\n    ],\n    fallback: true,\n  }\n}\n```\n\nFor [Automatically Statically Optimized](/docs/pages/building-your-application/rendering/automatic-static-optimization) and non-dynamic `getStaticProps` pages, **a version of the page will be generated for each locale**. This is important to consider because it can increase build times depending on how many locales are configured inside `getStaticProps`.\n\nFor example, if you have 50 locales configured with 10 non-dynamic pages using `getStaticProps`, this means `getStaticProps` will be called 500 times. 50 versions of the 10 pages will be generated during each build.\n\nTo decrease the build time of dynamic pages with `getStaticProps`, use a [`fallback` mode](/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/get-static-paths#fallback-true). This allows you to return only the most popular paths and locales from `getStaticPaths` for prerendering during the build. Then, Next.js will build the remaining pages at runtime as they are requested.\n\n### Automatically Statically Optimized Pages\n\nFor pages that are [automatically statically optimized](/docs/pages/building-your-application/rendering/automatic-static-optimization), a version of the page will be generated for each locale.\n\n### Non-dynamic getStaticProps Pages\n\nFor non-dynamic `getStaticProps` pages, a version is generated for each locale like above. `getStaticProps` is called with each `locale` that is being rendered. If you would like to opt-out of a certain locale from being pre-rendered, you can return `notFound: true` from `getStaticProps` and this variant of the page will not be generated.\n\n```js\nexport async function getStaticProps({ locale }) {\n  // Call an external API endpoint to get posts.\n  // You can use any data fetching library\n  const res = await fetch(`https://.../posts?locale=${locale}`)\n  const posts = await res.json()\n\n  if (posts.length === 0) {\n    return {\n      notFound: true,\n    }\n  }\n\n  // By returning { props: posts }, the Blog component\n  // will receive `posts` as a prop at build time\n  return {\n    props: {\n      posts,\n    },\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Limits for the i18n config\n\n- `locales`: 100 total locales\n- `domains`: 100 total locale domain items\n\n> **Good to know**: These limits have been added initially to prevent potential [performance issues at build time](#dynamic-routes-and-getstaticprops-pages). You can workaround these limits with custom routing using [Middleware](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/middleware) in Next.js 12.\n"},{"path":"docs/03-pages/01-building-your-application/03-data-fetching/02-get-static-paths.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/03-pages/01-building-your-application/03-data-fetching/02-get-static-paths.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-static-paths","sha":"77e74f5ead92ff202006c4ddb626bb4d65c6964d","size":5268,"content":"---\ntitle: getStaticPaths\ndescription: Fetch data and generate static pages with `getStaticPaths`.

You can validate code written inside `getStaticPaths` is removed from the client-side bundle [with this tool](https://next-code-elimination.vercel.app/).\n\n### How does getStaticProps run with regards to getStaticPaths\n\n- `getStaticProps` runs during `next build` for any `paths` returned during build\n- `getStaticProps` runs in the background when using `fallback: true`\n- `getStaticProps` is called before initial render when using `fallback: blocking`\n\n## Where can I use getStaticPaths\n\n- `getStaticPaths` **must** be used with `getStaticProps`\n- You **cannot** use `getStaticPaths` with [`getServerSideProps`](/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-server-side-props)\n- You can export `getStaticPaths` from a [Dynamic Route](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes) that also uses `getStaticProps`\n- You **cannot** export `getStaticPaths` from non-page file (e.g. your `components` folder)\n- You must export `getStaticPaths` as a standalone function, and not a property of the page component\n\n## Runs on every request in development\n\nIn development (`next dev`), `getStaticPaths` will be called on every request.\n\n## Generating paths on-demand\n\n`getStaticPaths` allows you to control which pages are generated during the build instead of on-demand with [`fallback`](/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/get-static-paths#fallback-blocking). Generating more pages during a build will cause slower builds.\n\nYou can defer generating all pages on-demand by returning an empty array for `paths`. This can be especially helpful when deploying your Next.js application to multiple environments. For example, you can have faster builds by generating all pages on-demand for previews (but not production builds). This is helpful for sites with hundreds/thousands of static pages.\n\n```jsx filename=\"pages/posts/[id].js\"\nexport async function getStaticPaths() {\n  // When this is true (in preview environments) don't\n  // prerender any static pages\n  // (faster builds, but slower initial page load)\n  if (process.env.SKIP_BUILD_STATIC_GENERATION) {\n    return {\n      paths: [],\n      fallback: 'blocking',\n    }\n  }\n\n  // Call an external API endpoint to get posts\n  const res = await fetch('https://.../posts')\n  const posts = await res.json()\n\n  // Get the paths we want to prerender based on posts\n  // In production environments, prerender all pages\n  // (slower builds, but faster initial page load)\n  const paths = posts.map((post) => ({\n    params: { id: post.id },\n  }))\n\n  // { fallback: false } means other routes should 404\n  return { paths, fallback: false }\n}\n```\n"},{"path":"docs/03-pages/01-building-your-application/03-data-fetching/01-get-static-props.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/03-pages/01-building-your-application/03-data-fetching/01-get-static-props.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-static-props","sha":"9f889c268c445328e0db2c680d0cb36a06da1092","size":9539,"content":"---\ntitle: getStaticProps\ndescription: Fetch data and generate static pages with `getStaticProps`. Learn more about this API for data fetching in Next.js.\n---\n\nIf you export a function called `getStaticProps` (Static Site Generation) from a page, Next.js will pre-render this page at build time using the props returned by `getStaticProps`.\n\n```tsx filename=\"pages/index.tsx\" switcher\nimport type { InferGetStaticPropsType, GetStaticProps } from 'next'\n\ntype Repo = {\n  name: string\n  stargazers_count: number\n}\n\nexport const getStaticProps = (async (context) => {\n  const res = await fetch('https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js')\n  const repo = await res.json()\n  return { props: { repo } }\n}) satisfies GetStaticProps<{\n  repo: Repo\n}>\n\nexport default function Page({\n  repo,\n}: InferGetStaticPropsType<typeof getStaticProps>) {\n  return repo.stargazers_count\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"pages/index.js\" switcher\nexport async function getStaticProps() {\n  const res = await fetch('https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js')\n  const repo = await res.json()\n  return { props: { repo } }\n}\n\nexport default function Page({ repo }) {\n  return repo.stargazers_count\n}\n```\n\n> Note that irrespective of rendering type, any `props` will be passed to the page component and can be viewed on the client-side in the initial HTML. This is to allow the page to be [hydrated](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/hydrate) correctly. Make sure that you don't pass any sensitive information that shouldn't be available on the client in `props`.\n\nThe [`getStaticProps` API reference](/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/get-static-props) covers all parameters and props that can be used with `getStaticProps`.\n\n## When should I use getStaticProps?\n\nYou should use `getStaticProps` if:\n\n- The data required to render the page is available at build time ahead of a user’s request\n- The data comes from a headless CMS\n- The page must be pre-rendered (for SEO) and be very fast — `getStaticProps` generates `HTML` and `JSON` files, both of which can be cached by a CDN for performance\n- The data can be publicly cached (not user-specific). This condition can be bypassed in certain specific situation by using a Middleware to rewrite the path.\n\n## When does getStaticProps run\n\n`getStaticProps` always runs on the server and never on the client. You can validate code written inside `getStaticProps` is removed from the client-side bundle [with this tool](https://next-code-elimination.vercel.app/).\n\n- `getStaticProps` always runs during `next build`\n- `getStaticProps` runs in the background when using [`fallback: true`](/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/get-static-paths#fallback-true)\n- `getStaticProps` is called before initial render when using [`fallback: blocking`](/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/get-static-paths#fallback-blocking)\n- `getStaticProps` runs in the background when using `revalidate`\n- `getStaticProps` runs on-demand in the background when using [`revalidate()`](/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/incremental-static-regeneration#on-demand-revalidation)\n\nWhen combined with [Incremental Static Regeneration](/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/incremental-static-regeneration), `getStaticProps` will run in the background while the stale page is being revalidated, and the fresh page served to the browser.\n\n`getStaticProps` does not have access to the incoming request (such as query parameters or HTTP headers) as it generates static HTML. If you need access to the request for your page, consider using [Middleware](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/middleware) in addition to `getStaticProps`.\n\n## Using getStaticProps to fetch data from a CMS\n\nThe following example shows how you can fetch a list of blog posts from a CMS.\n\n```tsx filename=\"pages/blog.tsx\" switcher\n// posts will be populated at build time by getStaticProps()\nexport default function Blog({ posts }) {\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {posts.map((post) => (\n        <li>{post.title}</li>\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  )\n}\n\n// This function gets called at build time on server-side.\n// It won't be called on client-side, so you can even do\n// direct database queries.\nexport async function getStaticProps() {\n  // Call an external API endpoint to get posts.\n  // You can use any data fetching library\n  const res = await fetch('https://.../posts')\n  const posts = await res.json()\n\n  // By returning { props: { posts } }, the Blog component\n  // will receive `posts` as a prop at build time\n  return {\n    props: {\n      posts,\n    },\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"pages/blog.js\" switcher\n// posts will be populated at build time by getStaticProps()\nexport default function Blog({ posts }) {\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {posts.map((post) => (\n        <li>{post.title}</li>\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  )\n}\n\n// This function gets called at build time on server-side.\n// It won't be called on client-side, so you can even do\n// direct database queries.\nexport async function getStaticProps() {\n  // Call an external API endpoint to get posts.\n  // You can use any data fetching library\n  const res = await fetch('https://.../posts')\n  const posts = await res.json()\n\n  // By returning { props: { posts } }, the Blog component\n  // will receive `posts` as a prop at build time\n  return {\n    props: {\n      posts,\n    },\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe [`getStaticProps` API reference](/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/get-static-props) covers all parameters and props that can be used with `getStaticProps`.\n\n## Write server-side code directly\n\nAs `getStaticProps` runs only on the server-side, it will never run on the client-side. It won’t even be included in the JS bundle for the browser, so you can write direct database queries without them being sent to browsers.\n\nThis means that instead of fetching an **API route** from `getStaticProps` (that itself fetches data from an external source), you can write the server-side code directly in `getStaticProps`.\n\nTake the following example. An API route is used to fetch some data from a CMS. That API route is then called directly from `getStaticProps`. This produces an additional call, reducing performance. Instead, the logic for fetching the data from the CMS can be shared by using a `lib/` directory. Then it can be shared with `getStaticProps`.\n\n```js filename=\"lib/load-posts.js\"\n// The following function is shared\n// with getStaticProps and API routes\n// from a `lib/` directory\nexport async function loadPosts() {\n  // Call an external API endpoint to get posts\n  const res = await fetch('https://.../posts/')\n  const data = await res.json()\n\n  return data\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"pages/blog.js\"\n// pages/blog.js\nimport { loadPosts } from '../lib/load-posts'\n\n// This function runs only on the server side\nexport async function getStaticProps() {\n  // Instead of fetching your `/api` route you can call the same\n  // function directly in `getStaticProps`\n  const posts = await loadPosts()\n\n  // Props returned will be passed to the page component\n  return { props: { posts } }\n}\n```\n\nAlternatively, if you are **not** using API routes to fetch data, then the [`fetch()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) API _can_ be used directly in `getStaticProps` to fetch data.\n\nTo verify what Next.js eliminates from the client-side bundle, you can use the [next-code-elimination tool](https://next-code-elimination.vercel.app/).\n\n## Statically generates both HTML and JSON\n\nWhen a page with `getStaticProps` is pre-rendered at build time, in addition to the page HTML file, Next.js generates a JSON file holding the result of running `getStaticProps`.\n\nThis JSON file will be used in client-side routing through [`next/link`](/docs/pages/api-reference/components/link) or [`next/router`](/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/use-router). When you navigate to a page that’s pre-rendered using `getStaticProps`, Next.js fetches this JSON file (pre-computed at build time) and uses it as the props for the page component. This means that client-side page transitions will **not** call `getStaticProps` as only the exported JSON is used.\n\nWhen using Incremental Static Generation, `getStaticProps` will be executed in the background to generate the JSON needed for client-side navigation. You may see this in the form of multiple requests being made for the same page, however, this is intended and has no impact on end-user performance.\n\n## Where can I use getStaticProps\n\n`getStaticProps` can only be exported from a **page**. You **cannot** export it from non-page files, `_app`, `_document`, or `_error`.\n\nOne of the reasons for this restriction is that React needs to have all the required data before the page is rendered.\n\nAlso, you must use export `getStaticProps` as a standalone function — it will **not** work if you add `getStaticProps` as a property of the page component.\n\n> **Good to know**: if you have created a [custom app](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/custom-app), ensure you are passing the `pageProps` to the page component as shown in the linked document, otherwise the props will be empty.\n\n## Runs on every request in development\n\nIn development (`next dev`), `getStaticProps` will be called on every request.\n\n## Preview Mode\n\nYou can temporarily bypass static generation and render the page at **request time** instead of build time using [**Preview Mode**](/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/preview-mode). For example, you might be using a headless CMS and want to preview drafts before they're published.\n"},{"path":"docs/03-pages/01-building-your-application/03-data-fetching/04-incremental-static-regeneration.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/03-pages/01-building-your-application/03-data-fetching/04-incremental-static-regeneration.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/incremental-static-regeneration","sha":"bb2b6aedec0b228ee4e5427d58684fe35d1e6f82","size":8599,"content":"---\ntitle: Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)\ndescription: Learn how to create or update static pages at runtime with Incremental Static Regeneration.\n---\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Examples</summary>\n\n- [Next.js Commerce](https://nextjs.org/commerce)\n- [GitHub Reactions Demo](https://reactions-demo.vercel.app/)\n- [Static Tweet Demo](https://static-tweet.vercel.app/)\n\n</details>\n\nNext.js allows you to create or update static pages _after_ you’ve built your site. Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) enables you to use static-generation on a per-page basis, **without needing to rebuild the entire site**. With ISR, you can retain the benefits of static while scaling to millions of pages.\n\n> **Good to know**: The [`edge` runtime](/docs/pages/api-reference/edge) is currently not compatible with ISR, although you can leverage `stale-while-revalidate` by setting the `cache-control` header manually.\n\nTo use ISR, add the `revalidate` prop to `getStaticProps`:\n\n```jsx\nfunction Blog({ posts }) {\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {posts.map((post) => (\n        <li key={post.id}>{post.title}</li>\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  )\n}\n\n// This function gets called at build time on server-side.\n// It may be called again, on a serverless function, if\n// revalidation is enabled and a new request comes in\nexport async function getStaticProps() {\n  const res = await fetch('https://.../posts')\n  const posts = await res.json()\n\n  return {\n    props: {\n      posts,\n    },\n    // Next.js will attempt to re-generate the page:\n    // - When a request comes in\n    // - At most once every 10 seconds\n    revalidate: 10, // In seconds\n  }\n}\n\n// This function gets called at build time on server-side.\n// It may be called again, on a serverless function, if\n// the path has not been generated.\nexport async function getStaticPaths() {\n  const res = await fetch('https://.../posts')\n  const posts = await res.json()\n\n  // Get the paths we want to pre-render based on posts\n  const paths = posts.map((post) => ({\n    params: { id: post.id },\n  }))\n\n  // We'll pre-render only these paths at build time.\n  // { fallback: 'blocking' } will server-render pages\n  // on-demand if the path doesn't exist.\n  return { paths, fallback: 'blocking' }\n}\n\nexport default Blog\n```\n\nWhen a request is made to a page that was pre-rendered at build time, it will initially show the cached page.\n\n- Any requests to the page after the initial request and before 10 seconds are also cached and instantaneous.\n- After the 10-second window, the next request will still show the cached (stale) page\n- Next.js triggers a regeneration of the page in the background.\n- Once the page generates successfully, Next.js will invalidate the cache and show the updated page. If the background regeneration fails, the old page would still be unaltered.\n\nWhen a request is made to a path that hasn’t been generated, Next.js will server-render the page on the first request. Future requests will serve the static file from the cache. ISR on Vercel [persists the cache globally and handles rollbacks](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/next.js/incremental-static-regeneration?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=next-website).\n\n> **Good to know**: Check if your upstream data provider has caching enabled by default. You might need to disable (e.g. `useCdn: false`), otherwise a revalidation won't be able to pull fresh data to update the ISR cache. Caching can occur at a CDN (for an endpoint being requested) when it returns the `Cache-Control` header.\n\n## On-Demand Revalidation\n\nIf you set a `revalidate` time of `60`, all visitors will see the same generated version of your site for one minute. The only way to invalidate the cache is from someone visiting that page after the minute has passed.\n\nStarting with `v12.2.0`, Next.js supports On-Demand Incremental Static Regeneration to manually purge the Next.js cache for a specific page. This makes it easier to update your site when:\n\n- Content from your headless CMS is created or updated\n- Ecommerce metadata changes (price, description, category, reviews, etc.)\n\nInside `getStaticProps`, you do not need to specify `revalidate` to use on-demand revalidation. If `revalidate` is omitted, Next.js will use the default value of `false` (no revalidation) and only revalidate the page on-demand when `revalidate()` is called.\n\n> **Good to know**: [Middleware](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/middleware) won't be executed for On-Demand ISR requests. Instead, call `revalidate()` on the _exact_ path that you want revalidated. For example, if you have `pages/blog/[slug].js` and a rewrite from `/post-1` -> `/blog/post-1`, you would need to call `res.revalidate('/blog/post-1')`.\n\n### Using On-Demand Revalidation\n\nFirst, create a secret token only known by your Next.js app. This secret will be used to prevent unauthorized access to the revalidation API Route. You can access the route (either manually or with a webhook) with the following URL structure:\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nhttps://<your-site.com>/api/revalidate?secret=<token>\n```\n\nNext, add the secret as an [Environment Variable](/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/environment-variables) to your application. Finally, create the revalidation API Route:\n\n```js filename=\"pages/api/revalidate.js\"\nexport default async function handler(req, res) {\n  // Check for secret to confirm this is a valid request\n  if (req.query.secret !== process.env.MY_SECRET_TOKEN) {\n    return res.status(401).json({ message: 'Invalid token' })\n  }\n\n  try {\n    // this should be the actual path not a rewritten path\n    // e.g. for \"/blog/[slug]\" this should be \"/blog/post-1\"\n    await res.revalidate('/path-to-revalidate')\n    return res.json({ revalidated: true })\n  } catch (err) {\n    // If there was an error, Next.js will continue\n    // to show the last successfully generated page\n    return res.status(500).send('Error revalidating')\n  }\n}\n```\n\n[View our demo](https://on-demand-isr.vercel.app) to see on-demand revalidation in action and provide feedback.\n\n### Testing on-Demand ISR during development\n\nWhen running locally with `next dev`, `getStaticProps` is invoked on every request. To verify your on-demand ISR configuration is correct, you will need to create a [production build](/docs/pages/api-reference/next-cli#build) and start the [production server](/docs/pages/api-reference/next-cli#production):\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\n$ next build\n$ next start\n```\n\nThen, you can confirm that static pages have successfully revalidated.\n\n## Error handling and revalidation\n\nIf there is an error inside `getStaticProps` when handling background regeneration, or you manually throw an error, the last successfully generated page will continue to show. On the next subsequent request, Next.js will retry calling `getStaticProps`.\n\n```jsx\nexport async function getStaticProps() {\n  // If this request throws an uncaught error, Next.js will\n  // not invalidate the currently shown page and\n  // retry getStaticProps on the next request.\n  const res = await fetch('https://.../posts')\n  const posts = await res.json()\n\n  if (!res.ok) {\n    // If there is a server error, you might want to\n    // throw an error instead of returning so that the cache is not updated\n    // until the next successful request.\n    throw new Error(`Failed to fetch posts, received status ${res.status}`)\n  }\n\n  // If the request was successful, return the posts\n  // and revalidate every 10 seconds.\n  return {\n    props: {\n      posts,\n    },\n    revalidate: 10,\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Self-hosting ISR\n\nIncremental Static Regeneration (ISR) works on [self-hosted Next.js sites](/docs/pages/building-your-application/deploying#self-hosting) out of the box when you use `next start`.\n\nLearn more about [self-hosting Next.js](/docs/pages/building-your-application/deploying#self-hosting).\n\n## Version History\n\n| Version   | Changes                                                                                 |\n| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `v14.1.0` | Custom `cacheHandler` is stable.                                                        |\n| `v12.2.0` | On-Demand ISR is stable                                                                 |\n| `v12.1.0` | On-Demand ISR added (beta).                                                             |\n| `v12.0.0` | [Bot-aware ISR fallback](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-12#bot-aware-isr-fallback) added. |\n| `v9.5.0`  | Base Path added.                                                                        |\n"},{"path":"docs/03-pages/01-building-your-application/03-data-fetching/index.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/03-pages/01-building-your-application/03-data-fetching/index.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching","sha":"91041ad6f94590f1454455a035c4420fc47824c0","size":2849,"content":"---\ntitle: Data Fetching\ndescription: Next.js allows you to fetch data in multiple ways, with pre-rendering, server-side rendering or static-site generation, and incremental static regeneration.

The example below shows how you can fetch data from a 3rd party API in `getServerSideProps`, and pass the data to the page as props:\n\n```tsx filename=\"pages/index.tsx\" switcher\nimport type { InferGetServerSidePropsType, GetServerSideProps } from 'next'\n\ntype Repo = {\n  name: string\n  stargazers_count: number\n}\n\nexport const getServerSideProps = (async () => {\n  // Fetch data from external API\n  const res = await fetch('https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js')\n  const repo: Repo = await res.json()\n  // Pass data to the page via props\n  return { props: { repo } }\n}) satisfies GetServerSideProps<{ repo: Repo }>\n\nexport default function Page({\n  repo,\n}: InferGetServerSidePropsType<typeof getServerSideProps>) {\n  return (\n    <main>\n      <p>{repo.stargazers_count}</p>\n    </main>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"pages/index.js\" switcher\nexport async function getServerSideProps() {\n  // Fetch data from external API\n  const res = await fetch('https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js')\n  const repo = await res.json()\n  // Pass data to the page via props\n  return { props: { repo } }\n}\n\nexport default function Page({ repo }) {\n  return (\n    <main>\n      <p>{repo.stargazers_count}</p>\n    </main>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n## When should I use `getServerSideProps`?\n\nYou should use `getServerSideProps` if you need to render a page that relies on personalized user data, or information that can only be known at request time. For example, `authorization` headers or a geolocation.\n\nIf you do not need to fetch the data at request time, or would prefer to cache the data and pre-rendered HTML, we recommend using [`getStaticProps`](/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-static-props).\n\n## Behavior\n\n- `getServerSideProps` runs on the server.\n- `getServerSideProps` can only be exported from a **page**.\n- `getServerSideProps` returns JSON.\n- When a user visits a page, `getServerSideProps` will be used to fetch data at request time, and the data is used to render the initial HTML of the page.\n- `props` passed to the page component can be viewed on the client as part of the initial HTML. This is to allow the page to be [hydrated](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/hydrate) correctly. Make sure that you don't pass any sensitive information that shouldn't be available on the client in `props`.\n- When a user visits the page through [`next/link`](/docs/pages/api-reference/components/link) or [`next/router`](/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/use-router), Next.js sends an API request to the server, which runs `getServerSideProps`.\n- You do not have to call a Next.js [API Route](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) to fetch data when using `getServerSideProps` since the function runs on the server. Instead, you can call a CMS, database, or other third-party APIs directly from inside `getServerSideProps`.\n\n> **Good to know:**\n>\n> - See [`getServerSideProps` API reference](/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/get-server-side-props) for parameters and props that can be used with `getServerSideProps`.\n> - You can use the [next-code-elimination tool](https://next-code-elimination.vercel.app/) to verify what Next.js eliminates from the client-side bundle.\n\n## Error Handling\n\nIf an error is thrown inside `getServerSideProps`, it will show the `pages/500.js` file. Check out the documentation for [500 page](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/custom-error#500-page) to learn more on how to create it. During development, this file will not be used and the development error overlay will be shown instead.\n\n## Edge Cases\n\n### Caching with Server-Side Rendering (SSR)\n\nYou can use caching headers (`Cache-Control`) inside `getServerSideProps` to cache dynamic responses. For example, using [`stale-while-revalidate`](https://web.dev/stale-while-revalidate/).\n\n```jsx\n// This value is considered fresh for ten seconds (s-maxage=10).\n// If a request is repeated within the next 10 seconds, the previously\n// cached value will still be fresh. If the request is repeated before 59 seconds,\n// the cached value will be stale but still render (stale-while-revalidate=59).\n//\n// In the background, a revalidation request will be made to populate the cache\n// with a fresh value. If you refresh the page, you will see the new value.\nexport async function getServerSideProps({ req, res }) {\n  res.setHeader(\n    'Cache-Control',\n    'public, s-maxage=10, stale-while-revalidate=59'\n  )\n\n  return {\n    props: {},\n  }\n}\n```\n\nHowever, before reaching for `cache-control`, we recommend seeing if [`getStaticProps`](/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-static-props) with [ISR](/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/incremental-static-regeneration) is a better fit for your use case.\n"},{"path":"docs/03-pages/01-building-your-application/03-data-fetching/03-forms-and-mutations.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/03-pages/01-building-your-application/03-data-fetching/03-forms-and-mutations.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/forms-and-mutations","sha":"cee8408f15f8256e4efd0aa5b070a366d1d3f0ea","size":11190,"content":"---\ntitle: Forms and Mutations\nnav_title: Forms and Mutations\ndescription: Learn how to handle form submissions and data mutations with Next.js.\n---\n\nForms enable you to create and update data in web applications. Next.js provides a powerful way to handle form submissions and data mutations using **API Routes**.\n\n> **Good to know:**\n>\n> - We will soon recommend [incrementally adopting](/docs/app/building-your-application/upgrading/app-router-migration) the App Router and using [Server Actions](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions-and-mutations) for handling form submissions and data mutations. Server Actions allow you to define asynchronous server functions that can be called directly from your components, without needing to manually create an API Route.\n> - API Routes [do not specify CORS headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS), meaning they are same-origin only by default.\n> - Since API Routes run on the server, we're able to use sensitive values (like API keys) through [Environment Variables](/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/environment-variables) without exposing them to the client. This is critical for the security of your application.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Server-only form\n\nWith the Pages Router, you need to manually create API endpoints to handle securely mutating data on the server.\n\n```ts filename=\"pages/api/submit.ts\" switcher\nimport type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next'\n\nexport default async function handler(\n  req: NextApiRequest,\n  res: NextApiResponse\n) {\n  const data = req.body\n  const id = await createItem(data)\n  res.status(200).json({ id })\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"pages/api/submit.js\" switcher\nexport default function handler(req, res) {\n  const data = req.body\n  const id = await createItem(data)\n  res.status(200).json({ id })\n}\n```\n\nThen, call the API Route from the client with an event handler:\n\n```tsx filename=\"pages/index.tsx\" switcher\nimport { FormEvent } from 'react'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  async function onSubmit(event: FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) {\n    event.preventDefault()\n\n    const formData = new FormData(event.currentTarget)\n    const response = await fetch('/api/submit', {\n      method: 'POST',\n      body: formData,\n    })\n\n    // Handle response if necessary\n    const data = await response.json()\n    // ...\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <form onSubmit={onSubmit}>\n      <input type=\"text\" name=\"name\" />\n      <button type=\"submit\">Submit</button>\n    </form>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"pages/index.jsx\" switcher\nexport default function Page() {\n  async function onSubmit(event) {\n    event.preventDefault()\n\n    const formData = new FormData(event.target)\n    const response = await fetch('/api/submit', {\n      method: 'POST',\n      body: formData,\n    })\n\n    // Handle response if necessary\n    const data = await response.json()\n    // ...\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <form onSubmit={onSubmit}>\n      <input type=\"text\" name=\"name\" />\n      <button type=\"submit\">Submit</button>\n    </form>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n## Form validation\n\nWe recommend using HTML validation like `required` and `type=\"email\"` for basic client-side form validation.\n\nFor more advanced server-side validation, you can use a schema validation library like [zod](https://zod.dev/) to validate the form fields before mutating the data:\n\n```ts filename=\"pages/api/submit.ts\" switcher\nimport type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next'\nimport { z } from 'zod'\n\nconst schema = z.object({\n  // ...\n})\n\nexport default async function handler(\n  req: NextApiRequest,\n  res: NextApiResponse\n) {\n  const parsed = schema.parse(req.body)\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"pages/api/submit.js\" switcher\nimport { z } from 'zod'\n\nconst schema = z.object({\n  // ...\n})\n\nexport default async function handler(req, res) {\n  const parsed = schema.parse(req.body)\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n### Error handling\n\nYou can use React state to show an error message when a form submission fails:\n\n```tsx filename=\"pages/index.tsx\" switcher\nimport React, { useState, FormEvent } from 'react'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState<boolean>(false)\n  const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null)\n\n  async function onSubmit(event: FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) {\n    event.preventDefault()\n    setIsLoading(true)\n    setError(null) // Clear previous errors when a new request starts\n\n    try {\n      const formData = new FormData(event.currentTarget)\n      const response = await fetch('/api/submit', {\n        method: 'POST',\n        body: formData,\n      })\n\n      if (!response.ok) {\n        throw new Error('Failed to submit the data. Please try again.')\n      }\n\n      // Handle response if necessary\n      const data = await response.json()\n      // ...\n    } catch (error) {\n      // Capture the error message to display to the user\n      setError(error.message)\n      console.error(error)\n    } finally {\n      setIsLoading(false)\n    }\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      {error && <div style={{ color: 'red' }}>{error}</div>}\n      <form onSubmit={onSubmit}>\n        <input type=\"text\" name=\"name\" />\n        <button type=\"submit\" disabled={isLoading}>\n          {isLoading ? 'Loading...' : 'Submit'}\n        </button>\n      </form>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"pages/index.jsx\" switcher\nimport React, { useState } from 'react'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false)\n  const [error, setError] = useState(null)\n\n  async function onSubmit(event) {\n    event.preventDefault()\n    setIsLoading(true)\n    setError(null) // Clear previous errors when a new request starts\n\n    try {\n      const formData = new FormData(event.currentTarget)\n      const response = await fetch('/api/submit', {\n        method: 'POST',\n        body: formData,\n      })\n\n      if (!response.ok) {\n        throw new Error('Failed to submit the data. Please try again.')\n      }\n\n      // Handle response if necessary\n      const data = await response.json()\n      // ...\n    } catch (error) {\n      // Capture the error message to display to the user\n      setError(error.message)\n      console.error(error)\n    } finally {\n      setIsLoading(false)\n    }\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      {error && <div style={{ color: 'red' }}>{error}</div>}\n      <form onSubmit={onSubmit}>\n        <input type=\"text\" name=\"name\" />\n        <button type=\"submit\" disabled={isLoading}>\n          {isLoading ? 'Loading...' : 'Submit'}\n        </button>\n      </form>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n## Displaying loading state\n\nYou can use React state to show a loading state when a form is submitting on the server:\n\n```tsx filename=\"pages/index.tsx\" switcher\nimport React, { useState, FormEvent } from 'react'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState<boolean>(false)\n\n  async function onSubmit(event: FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) {\n    event.preventDefault()\n    setIsLoading(true) // Set loading to true when the request starts\n\n    try {\n      const formData = new FormData(event.currentTarget)\n      const response = await fetch('/api/submit', {\n        method: 'POST',\n        body: formData,\n      })\n\n      // Handle response if necessary\n      const data = await response.json()\n      // ...\n    } catch (error) {\n      // Handle error if necessary\n      console.error(error)\n    } finally {\n      setIsLoading(false) // Set loading to false when the request completes\n    }\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <form onSubmit={onSubmit}>\n      <input type=\"text\" name=\"name\" />\n      <button type=\"submit\" disabled={isLoading}>\n        {isLoading ?

'Loading...' : 'Submit'}\n      </button>\n    </form>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### Redirecting\n\nIf you would like to redirect the user to a different route after a mutation, you can [`redirect`](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes#response-helpers) to any absolute or relative URL:\n\n```ts filename=\"pages/api/submit.ts\" switcher\nimport type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next'\n\nexport default async function handler(\n  req: NextApiRequest,\n  res: NextApiResponse\n) {\n  const id = await addPost()\n  res.redirect(307, `/post/${id}`)\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"pages/api/submit.js\" switcher\nexport default async function handler(req, res) {\n  const id = await addPost()\n  res.redirect(307, `/post/${id}`)\n}\n```\n\n### Setting cookies\n\nYou can set cookies inside an API Route using the `setHeader` method on the response:\n\n```ts filename=\"pages/api/cookie.ts\" switcher\nimport type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next'\n\nexport default async function handler(\n  req: NextApiRequest,\n  res: NextApiResponse\n) {\n  res.setHeader('Set-Cookie', 'username=lee; Path=/; HttpOnly')\n  res.status(200).send('Cookie has been set.')\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"pages/api/cookie.js\" switcher\nexport default async function handler(req, res) {\n  res.setHeader('Set-Cookie', 'username=lee; Path=/; HttpOnly')\n  res.status(200).send('Cookie has been set.')\n}\n```\n\n### Reading cookies\n\nYou can read cookies inside an API Route using the [`cookies`](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes#request-helpers) request helper:\n\n```ts filename=\"pages/api/cookie.ts\" switcher\nimport type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next'\n\nexport default async function handler(\n  req: NextApiRequest,\n  res: NextApiResponse\n) {\n  const auth = req.cookies.authorization\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"pages/api/cookie.js\" switcher\nexport default async function handler(req, res) {\n  const auth = req.cookies.authorization\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n### Deleting cookies\n\nYou can delete cookies inside an API Route using the `setHeader` method on the response:\n\n```ts filename=\"pages/api/cookie.ts\" switcher\nimport type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next'\n\nexport default async function handler(\n  req: NextApiRequest,\n  res: NextApiResponse\n) {\n  res.setHeader('Set-Cookie', 'username=; Path=/; HttpOnly; Max-Age=0')\n  res.status(200).send('Cookie has been deleted.')\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"pages/api/cookie.js\" switcher\nexport default async function handler(req, res) {\n  res.setHeader('Set-Cookie', 'username=; Path=/; HttpOnly; Max-Age=0')\n  res.status(200).send('Cookie has been deleted.')\n}\n```\n"},{"path":"docs/03-pages/01-building-your-application/03-data-fetching/05-client-side.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/03-pages/01-building-your-application/03-data-fetching/05-client-side.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/client-side","sha":"969d017511386384b4b57e0826903a79aef5315b","size":2682,"content":"---\ntitle: Client-side Fetching\ndescription: Learn about client-side data fetching, and how to use SWR, a data fetching React hook library that handles caching, revalidation, focus tracking, refetching on interval and more.\n---\n\nClient-side data fetching is useful when your page doesn't require SEO indexing, when you don't need to pre-render your data, or when the content of your pages needs to update frequently. Unlike the server-side rendering APIs, you can use client-side data fetching at the component level.\n\nIf done at the page level, the data is fetched at runtime, and the content of the page is updated as the data changes. When used at the component level, the data is fetched at the time of the component mount, and the content of the component is updated as the data changes.\n\nIt's important to note that using client-side data fetching can affect the performance of your application and the load speed of your pages. This is because the data fetching is done at the time of the component or pages mount, and the data is not cached.\n\n## Client-side data fetching with useEffect\n\nThe following example shows how you can fetch data on the client side using the useEffect hook.\n\n```jsx\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react'\n\nfunction Profile() {\n  const [data, setData] = useState(null)\n  const [isLoading, setLoading] = useState(true)\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    fetch('/api/profile-data')\n      .then((res) => res.json())\n      .then((data) => {\n        setData(data)\n        setLoading(false)\n      })\n  }, [])\n\n  if (isLoading) return <p>Loading...</p>\n  if (!data) return <p>No profile data</p>\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>{data.name}</h1>\n      <p>{data.bio}</p>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n## Client-side data fetching with SWR\n\nThe team behind Next.js has created a React hook library for data fetching called [**SWR**](https://swr.vercel.app/). It is **highly recommended** if you are fetching data on the client-side. It handles caching, revalidation, focus tracking, refetching on intervals, and more.\n\nUsing the same example as above, we can now use SWR to fetch the profile data. SWR will automatically cache the data for us and will revalidate the data if it becomes stale.\n\nFor more information on using SWR, check out the [SWR docs](https://swr.vercel.app/docs/getting-started).\n\n```jsx\nimport useSWR from 'swr'\n\nconst fetcher = (...args) => fetch(...args).then((res) => res.json())\n\nfunction Profile() {\n  const { data, error } = useSWR('/api/profile-data', fetcher)\n\n  if (error) return <div>Failed to load</div>\n  if (!data) return <div>Loading...</div>\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>{data.name}</h1>\n      <p>{data.bio}</p>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n"},{"path":"docs/03-pages/01-building-your-application/02-rendering/04-automatic-static-optimization.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/03-pages/01-building-your-application/02-rendering/04-automatic-static-optimization.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/rendering/automatic-static-optimization","sha":"09520d91785ff9254cd710ea815799ee4177d9f6","size":3788,"content":"---\ntitle: Automatic Static Optimization\ndescription: Next.js automatically optimizes your app to be static HTML whenever possible. Learn how it works here.\n---\n\nNext.js automatically determines that a page is static (can be prerendered) if it has no blocking data requirements. This determination is made by the absence of `getServerSideProps` and `getInitialProps` in the page.\n\nThis feature allows Next.js to emit hybrid applications that contain **both server-rendered and statically generated pages**.\n\n> Statically generated pages are still reactive: Next.js will hydrate your application client-side to give it full interactivity.\n\nOne of the main benefits of this feature is that optimized pages require no server-side computation, and can be instantly streamed to the end-user from multiple CDN locations. The result is an _ultra fast_ loading experience for your users.\n\n## How it works\n\nIf `getServerSideProps` or `getInitialProps` is present in a page, Next.js will switch to render the page on-demand, per-request (meaning [Server-Side Rendering](/docs/pages/building-your-application/rendering/server-side-rendering)).\n\nIf the above is not the case, Next.js will **statically optimize** your page automatically by prerendering the page to static HTML.\n\nDuring prerendering, the router's `query` object will be empty since we do not have `query` information to provide during this phase. After hydration, Next.js will trigger an update to your application to provide the route parameters in the `query` object.\n\nThe cases where the query will be updated after hydration triggering another render are:\n\n- The page is a [dynamic-route](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes).\n- The page has query values in the URL.\n- [Rewrites](/docs/pages/api-reference/next-config-js/rewrites) are configured in your `next.config.js` since these can have parameters that may need to be parsed and provided in the `query`.\n\nTo be able to distinguish if the query is fully updated and ready for use, you can leverage the `isReady` field on [`next/router`](/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/use-router#router-object).\n\n> **Good to know**: Parameters added with [dynamic routes](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes) to a page that's using [`getStaticProps`](/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-static-props) will always be available inside the `query` object.\n\n`next build` will emit `.html` files for statically optimized pages. For example, the result for the page `pages/about.js` would be:\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\n.next/server/pages/about.html\n```\n\nAnd if you add `getServerSideProps` to the page, it will then be JavaScript, like so:\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\n.next/server/pages/about.js\n```\n\n## Caveats\n\n- If you have a [custom `App`](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/custom-app) with `getInitialProps` then this optimization will be turned off in pages without [Static Generation](/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-static-props).\n- If you have a [custom `Document`](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/custom-document) with `getInitialProps` be sure you check if `ctx.req` is defined before assuming the page is server-side rendered. `ctx.req` will be `undefined` for pages that are prerendered.\n- Avoid using the `asPath` value on [`next/router`](/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/use-router#router-object) in the rendering tree until the router's `isReady` field is `true`. Statically optimized pages only know `asPath` on the client and not the server, so using it as a prop may lead to mismatch errors. The [`active-class-name` example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/active-class-name) demonstrates one way to use `asPath` as a prop.\n"},{"path":"docs/03-pages/01-building-your-application/02-rendering/05-client-side-rendering.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/03-pages/01-building-your-application/02-rendering/05-client-side-rendering.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/rendering/client-side-rendering","sha":"4650b31593945daf2a541293b418a69378147a53","size":4115,"content":"---\ntitle: Client-side Rendering (CSR)\ndescription: Learn how to implement client-side rendering in the Pages Router.\nrelated:\n  description: Learn about the alternative rendering methods in Next.js.\n  links:\n    - pages/building-your-application/rendering/server-side-rendering\n    - pages/building-your-application/rendering/static-site-generation\n    - pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/incremental-static-regeneration\n    - app/building-your-application/routing/loading-ui-and-streaming\n---\n\nIn Client-Side Rendering (CSR) with React, the browser downloads a minimal HTML page and the JavaScript needed for the page. The JavaScript is then used to update the DOM and render the page. When the application is first loaded, the user may notice a slight delay before they can see the full page, this is because the page isn't fully rendered until all the JavaScript is downloaded, parsed, and executed.\n\nAfter the page has been loaded for the first time, navigating to other pages on the same website is typically faster, as only necessary data needs to be fetched, and JavaScript can re-render parts of the page without requiring a full page refresh.\n\nIn Next.js, there are two ways you can implement client-side rendering:\n\n1. Using React's `useEffect()` hook inside your pages instead of the server-side rendering methods ([`getStaticProps`](/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-static-props) and [`getServerSideProps`](/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-server-side-props)).\n2. Using a data fetching library like [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/) or [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/) to fetch data on the client (recommended).\n\nHere's an example of using `useEffect()` inside a Next.js page:\n\n```jsx filename=\"pages/index.js\"\nimport React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react'\n\nexport function Page() {\n  const [data, setData] = useState(null)\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const fetchData = async () => {\n      const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data')\n      if (!response.ok) {\n        throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`)\n      }\n      const result = await response.json()\n      setData(result)\n    }\n\n    fetchData().catch((e) => {\n      // handle the error as needed\n      console.error('An error occurred while fetching the data: ', e)\n    })\n  }, [])\n\n  return <p>{data ? `Your data: ${data}` : 'Loading...'}</p>\n}\n```\n\nIn the example above, the component starts by rendering `Loading...`. Then, once the data is fetched, it re-renders and displays the data.\n\nAlthough fetching data in a `useEffect` is a pattern you may see in older React Applications, we recommend using a data-fetching library for better performance, caching, optimistic updates, and more. Here's a minimum example using [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/) to fetch data on the client:\n\n```jsx filename=\"pages/index.js\"\nimport useSWR from 'swr'\n\nexport function Page() {\n  const { data, error, isLoading } = useSWR(\n    'https://api.example.com/data',\n    fetcher\n  )\n\n  if (error) return <p>Failed to load.</p>\n  if (isLoading) return <p>Loading...</p>\n\n  return <p>Your Data: {data}</p>\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know**:\n>\n> Keep in mind that CSR can impact SEO. Some search engine crawlers might not execute JavaScript and therefore only see the initial empty or loading state of your application. It can also lead to performance issues for users with slower internet connections or devices, as they need to wait for all the JavaScript to load and run before they can see the full page. Next.js promotes a hybrid approach that allows you to use a combination of [server-side rendering](/docs/pages/building-your-application/rendering/server-side-rendering), [static site generation](/docs/pages/building-your-application/rendering/static-site-generation), and client-side rendering, **depending on the needs of each page** in your application. In the App Router, you can also use [Loading UI with Suspense](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/loading-ui-and-streaming) to show a loading indicator while the page is being rendered.\n"},{"path":"docs/03-pages/01-building-your-application/02-rendering/01-server-side-rendering.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/03-pages/01-building-your-application/02-rendering/01-server-side-rendering.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/rendering/server-side-rendering","sha":"8f240a6e6b4e9097ab21caa95a142489c9c0e5d5","size":1320,"content":"---\ntitle: Server-side Rendering (SSR)\ndescription: Use Server-side Rendering to render pages on each request.\n---\n\n> Also referred to as \"SSR\" or \"Dynamic Rendering\".\n\nIf a page uses **Server-side Rendering**, the page HTML is generated on **each request**.\n\nTo use Server-side Rendering for a page, you need to `export` an `async` function called `getServerSideProps`. This function will be called by the server on every request.\n\nFor example, suppose that your page needs to pre-render frequently updated data (fetched from an external API). You can write `getServerSideProps` which fetches this data and passes it to `Page` like below:\n\n```jsx\nexport default function Page({ data }) {\n  // Render data...\n}\n\n// This gets called on every request\nexport async function getServerSideProps() {\n  // Fetch data from external API\n  const res = await fetch(`https://.../data`)\n  const data = await res.json()\n\n  // Pass data to the page via props\n  return { props: { data } }\n}\n```\n\nAs you can see, `getServerSideProps` is similar to `getStaticProps`, but the difference is that `getServerSideProps` is run on every request instead of on build time.\n\nTo learn more about how `getServerSideProps` works, check out our [Data Fetching documentation](/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-server-side-props).\n"},{"path":"docs/03-pages/01-building-your-application/02-rendering/06-edge-and-nodejs-runtimes.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/03-pages/01-building-your-application/02-rendering/06-edge-and-nodejs-runtimes.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/rendering/edge-and-nodejs-runtimes","sha":"37529e88b62eeb50468c20b1f5e6d24d80287187","size":528,"content":"---\ntitle: Edge and Node.js Runtimes\ndescription: Learn more about the switchable runtimes (Edge and Node.js) in Next.js.\nsource: app/building-your-application/rendering/edge-and-nodejs-runtimes\n---\n\n{/* DO NOT EDIT.

That means in production, the page HTML is generated when you run `next build`. This HTML will then be reused on each request. It can be cached by a CDN.\n\nIn Next.js, you can statically generate pages **with or without data**. Let's take a look at each case.\n\n### Static Generation without data\n\nBy default, Next.js pre-renders pages using Static Generation without fetching data. Here's an example:\n\n```jsx\nfunction About() {\n  return <div>About</div>\n}\n\nexport default About\n```\n\nNote that this page does not need to fetch any external data to be pre-rendered. In cases like this, Next.js generates a single HTML file per page during build time.\n\n### Static Generation with data\n\nSome pages require fetching external data for pre-rendering. There are two scenarios, and one or both might apply. In each case, you can use these functions that Next.js provides:\n\n1. Your page **content** depends on external data: Use `getStaticProps`.\n2. Your page **paths** depend on external data: Use `getStaticPaths` (usually in addition to `getStaticProps`).\n\n#### Scenario 1: Your page content depends on external data\n\n**Example**: Your blog page might need to fetch the list of blog posts from a CMS (content management system).\n\n```jsx\n// TODO: Need to fetch `posts` (by calling some API endpoint)\n//       before this page can be pre-rendered.\nexport default function Blog({ posts }) {\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {posts.map((post) => (\n        <li>{post.title}</li>\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nTo fetch this data on pre-render, Next.js allows you to `export` an `async` function called `getStaticProps` from the same file. This function gets called at build time and lets you pass fetched data to the page's `props` on pre-render.\n\n```jsx\nexport default function Blog({ posts }) {\n  // Render posts...\n}\n\n// This function gets called at build time\nexport async function getStaticProps() {\n  // Call an external API endpoint to get posts\n  const res = await fetch('https://.../posts')\n  const posts = await res.json()\n\n  // By returning { props: { posts } }, the Blog component\n  // will receive `posts` as a prop at build time\n  return {\n    props: {\n      posts,\n    },\n  }\n}\n```\n\nTo learn more about how `getStaticProps` works, check out the [Data Fetching documentation](/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-static-props).\n\n#### Scenario 2: Your page paths depend on external data\n\nNext.js allows you to create pages with **dynamic routes**. For example, you can create a file called `pages/posts/[id].js` to show a single blog post based on `id`. This will allow you to show a blog post with `id: 1` when you access `posts/1`.\n\n> To learn more about dynamic routing, check the [Dynamic Routing documentation](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes).\n\nHowever, which `id` you want to pre-render at build time might depend on external data.\n\n**Example**: suppose that you've only added one blog post (with `id: 1`) to the database. In this case, you'd only want to pre-render `posts/1` at build time.\n\nLater, you might add the second post with `id: 2`. Then you'd want to pre-render `posts/2` as well.\n\nSo your page **paths** that are pre-rendered depend on external data. To handle this, Next.js lets you `export` an `async` function called `getStaticPaths` from a dynamic page (`pages/posts/[id].js` in this case). This function gets called at build time and lets you specify which paths you want to pre-render.\n\n```jsx\n// This function gets called at build time\nexport async function getStaticPaths() {\n  // Call an external API endpoint to get posts\n  const res = await fetch('https://.../posts')\n  const posts = await res.json()\n\n  // Get the paths we want to pre-render based on posts\n  const paths = posts.map((post) => ({\n    params: { id: post.id },\n  }))\n\n  // We'll pre-render only these paths at build time.\n  // { fallback: false } means other routes should 404.\n  return { paths, fallback: false }\n}\n```\n\nAlso in `pages/posts/[id].js`, you need to export `getStaticProps` so that you can fetch the data about the post with this `id` and use it to pre-render the page:\n\n```jsx\nexport default function Post({ post }) {\n  // Render post...\n}\n\nexport async function getStaticPaths() {\n  // ...\n}\n\n// This also gets called at build time\nexport async function getStaticProps({ params }) {\n  // params contains the post `id`.\n  // If the route is like /posts/1, then params.id is 1\n  const res = await fetch(`https://.../posts/${params.id}`)\n  const post = await res.json()\n\n  // Pass post data to the page via props\n  return { props: { post } }\n}\n```\n\nTo learn more about how `getStaticPaths` works, check out the [Data Fetching documentation](/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-static-paths).\n\n### When should I use Static Generation?\n\nWe recommend using **Static Generation** (with and without data) whenever possible because your page can be built once and served by CDN, which makes it much faster than having a server render the page on every request.\n\nYou can use Static Generation for many types of pages, including:\n\n- Marketing pages\n- Blog posts and portfolios\n- E-commerce product listings\n- Help and documentation\n\nYou should ask yourself: \"Can I pre-render this page **ahead** of a user's request?\" If the answer is yes, then you should choose Static Generation.\n\nOn the other hand, Static Generation is **not** a good idea if you cannot pre-render a page ahead of a user's request. Maybe your page shows frequently updated data, and the page content changes on every request.\n\nIn cases like this, you can do one of the following:\n\n- Use Static Generation with **Client-side data fetching:** You can skip pre-rendering some parts of a page and then use client-side JavaScript to populate them. To learn more about this approach, check out the [Data Fetching documentation](/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/client-side).\n- Use **Server-Side Rendering:** Next.js pre-renders a page on each request. It will be slower because the page cannot be cached by a CDN, but the pre-rendered page will always be up-to-date. We'll talk about this approach below.\n"},{"path":"docs/03-pages/01-building-your-application/02-rendering/index.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/03-pages/01-building-your-application/02-rendering/index.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/rendering","sha":"f63e9312d75b74acb86024f871f91a03524e85e9","size":1752,"content":"---\ntitle: Rendering\ndescription: Learn the fundamentals of rendering in React and Next.js.\n---\n\nBy default, Next.js **pre-renders** every page. This means that Next.js generates HTML for each page in advance, instead of having it all done by client-side JavaScript. Pre-rendering can result in better performance and SEO.\n\nEach generated HTML is associated with minimal JavaScript code necessary for that page. When a page is loaded by the browser, its JavaScript code runs and makes the page fully interactive (this process is called [hydration](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/client/hydrateRoot) in React).\n\n### Pre-rendering\n\nNext.js has two forms of pre-rendering: **Static Generation** and **Server-side Rendering**. The difference is in **when** it generates the HTML for a page.\n\n- Static Generation: The HTML is generated at **build time** and will be reused on each request.\n- Server-side Rendering: The HTML is generated on **each request**.\n\nImportantly, Next.js lets you choose which pre-rendering form you'd like to use for each page. You can create a \"hybrid\" Next.js app by using Static Generation for most pages and using Server-side Rendering for others.\n\nWe recommend using Static Generation over Server-side Rendering for performance reasons. Statically generated pages can be cached by CDN with no extra configuration to boost performance. However, in some cases, Server-side Rendering might be the only option.\n\nYou can also use client-side data fetching along with Static Generation or Server-side Rendering. That means some parts of a page can be rendered entirely by clientside JavaScript. To learn more, take a look at the [Data Fetching](/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/client-side) documentation.\n"},{"path":"docs/03-pages/01-building-your-application/08-authentication/index.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/03-pages/01-building-your-application/08-authentication/index.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/authentication","sha":"5b48f4eb64be35cec696cf285e40e6a6f46e51a5","size":567,"content":"---\ntitle: Authentication\ndescription: Learn how to implement authentication in Next.js, covering best practices, securing routes, authorization techniques, and session management.\nsource: app/building-your-application/authentication\n---\n\n{/* DO NOT EDIT.

But if you want to extend the default Babel configs, it's also possible.\n\n## Adding Presets and Plugins\n\nTo start, you only need to define a `.babelrc` file (or `babel.config.js`) in the root directory of your project. If such a file is found, it will be considered as the _source of truth_, and therefore it needs to define what Next.js needs as well, which is the `next/babel` preset.\n\nHere's an example `.babelrc` file:\n\n```json filename=\".babelrc\"\n{\n  \"presets\": [\"next/babel\"],\n  \"plugins\": []\n}\n```\n\nYou can [take a look at this file](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/packages/next/src/build/babel/preset.ts) to learn about the presets included by `next/babel`.\n\nTo add presets/plugins **without configuring them**, you can do it this way:\n\n```json filename=\".babelrc\"\n{\n  \"presets\": [\"next/babel\"],\n  \"plugins\": [\"@babel/plugin-proposal-do-expressions\"]\n}\n```\n\n## Customizing Presets and Plugins\n\nTo add presets/plugins **with custom configuration**, do it on the `next/babel` preset like so:\n\n```json filename=\".babelrc\"\n{\n  \"presets\": [\n    [\n      \"next/babel\",\n      {\n        \"preset-env\": {},\n        \"transform-runtime\": {},\n        \"styled-jsx\": {},\n        \"class-properties\": {}\n      }\n    ]\n  ],\n  \"plugins\": []\n}\n```\n\nTo learn more about the available options for each config, visit babel's [documentation](https://babeljs.io/docs/) site.\n\n> **Good to know**:\n>\n> - Next.js uses the [**current** Node.js version](https://github.com/nodejs/release#release-schedule) for server-side compilations.\n> - The `modules` option on `\"preset-env\"` should be kept to `false`, otherwise webpack code splitting is turned off.\n"},{"path":"docs/03-pages/01-building-your-application/06-configuring/03-environment-variables.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/03-pages/01-building-your-application/06-configuring/03-environment-variables.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/environment-variables","sha":"ed4feb1b705fc33095a41333f4f3d5c41cf593c6","size":526,"content":"---\ntitle: Environment Variables\ndescription: Learn to add and access environment variables in your Next.js application.\nsource: app/building-your-application/configuring/environment-variables\n---\n\n{/* DO NOT EDIT.

It is a modal that covers the webpage. It is **only** visible when the development server runs using `next dev` via `pnpm dev`, `npm run dev`, `yarn dev`, or `bun dev` and will not be shown in production. Fixing the error will automatically dismiss the overlay.\n\nHere is an example of an overlay:\n\n{/* TODO UPDATE SCREENSHOT */}\n![Example of an overlay when in development mode](https://assets.vercel.com/image/upload/v1645118290/docs-assets/static/docs/error-handling/overlay.png)\n\n## Handling Server Errors\n\nNext.js provides a static 500 page by default to handle server-side errors that occur in your application. You can also [customize this page](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/custom-error#customizing-the-500-page) by creating a `pages/500.js` file.\n\nHaving a 500 page in your application does not show specific errors to the app user.\n\nYou can also use [404 page](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/custom-error#404-page) to handle specific runtime error like `file not found`.\n\n## Handling Client Errors\n\nReact [Error Boundaries](https://react.dev/reference/react/Component#catching-rendering-errors-with-an-error-boundary) is a graceful way to handle a JavaScript error on the client so that the other parts of the application continue working. In addition to preventing the page from crashing, it allows you to provide a custom fallback component and even log error information.\n\nTo use Error Boundaries for your Next.js application, you must create a class component `ErrorBoundary` and wrap the `Component` prop in the `pages/_app.js` file. This component will be responsible to:\n\n- Render a fallback UI after an error is thrown\n- Provide a way to reset the Application's state\n- Log error information\n\nYou can create an `ErrorBoundary` class component by extending `React.Component`. For example:\n\n```jsx\nclass ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props)\n\n    // Define a state variable to track whether is an error or not\n    this.state = { hasError: false }\n  }\n  static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {\n    // Update state so the next render will show the fallback UI\n\n    return { hasError: true }\n  }\n  componentDidCatch(error, errorInfo) {\n    // You can use your own error logging service here\n    console.log({ error, errorInfo })\n  }\n  render() {\n    // Check if the error is thrown\n    if (this.state.hasError) {\n      // You can render any custom fallback UI\n      return (\n        <div>\n          <h2>Oops, there is an error!</h2>\n          <button\n            type=\"button\"\n            onClick={() => this.setState({ hasError: false })}\n          >\n            Try again?\n          </button>\n        </div>\n      )\n    }\n\n    // Return children components in case of no error\n\n    return this.props.children\n  }\n}\n\nexport default ErrorBoundary\n```\n\nThe `ErrorBoundary` component keeps track of an `hasError` state. The value of this state variable is a boolean. When the value of `hasError` is `true`, then the `ErrorBoundary` component will render a fallback UI. Otherwise, it will render the children components.\n\nAfter creating an `ErrorBoundary` component, import it in the `pages/_app.js` file to wrap the `Component` prop in your Next.js application.\n\n```jsx\n// Import the ErrorBoundary component\nimport ErrorBoundary from '../components/ErrorBoundary'\n\nfunction MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {\n  return (\n    // Wrap the Component prop with ErrorBoundary component\n    <ErrorBoundary>\n      <Component {...pageProps} />\n    </ErrorBoundary>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default MyApp\n```\n\nYou can learn more about [Error Boundaries](https://react.dev/reference/react/Component#catching-rendering-errors-with-an-error-boundary) in React's documentation.\n\n### Reporting Errors\n\nTo monitor client errors, use a service like [Sentry](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-sentry), Bugsnag or Datadog.\n"},{"path":"docs/03-pages/01-building-your-application/06-configuring/05-src-directory.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/03-pages/01-building-your-application/06-configuring/05-src-directory.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/src-directory","sha":"fd8ea6a7c8a72263ee3af085a1a0da415cc868ff","size":521,"content":"---\ntitle: src Directory\ndescription: Save pages under the `src` directory as an alternative to the root `pages` directory.\nsource: app/building-your-application/configuring/src-directory\n---\n\n{/* DO NOT EDIT.

However, it’s not ideal when you’re writing a draft on your headless CMS and want to **preview** the draft immediately on your page. You’d want Next.js to render these pages at **request time** instead of build time and fetch the draft content instead of the published content. You’d want Next.js to bypass Static Generation only for this specific case.\n\nNext.js has a feature called **Preview Mode** which solves this problem. Here are instructions on how to use it.\n\n## Step 1: Create and access a preview API route\n\n> Take a look at the [API Routes documentation](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) first if you’re not familiar with Next.js API Routes.\n\nFirst, create a **preview API route**. It can have any name - e.g. `pages/api/preview.js` (or `.ts` if using TypeScript).\n\nIn this API route, you need to call `setPreviewData` on the response object. The argument for `setPreviewData` should be an object, and this can be used by `getStaticProps` (more on this later). For now, we’ll use `{}`.\n\n```js\nexport default function handler(req, res) {\n  // ...\n  res.setPreviewData({})\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n`res.setPreviewData` sets some **cookies** on the browser which turns on the preview mode. Any requests to Next.js containing these cookies will be considered as the **preview mode**, and the behavior for statically generated pages will change (more on this later).\n\nYou can test this manually by creating an API route like below and accessing it from your browser manually:\n\n```js filename=\"pages/api/preview.js\"\n// simple example for testing it manually from your browser.\nexport default function handler(req, res) {\n  res.setPreviewData({})\n  res.end('Preview mode enabled')\n}\n```\n\nIf you open your browser’s developer tools and visit `/api/preview`, you’ll notice that the `__prerender_bypass` and `__next_preview_data` cookies will be set on this request.\n\n### Securely accessing it from your Headless CMS\n\nIn practice, you’d want to call this API route _securely_ from your headless CMS. The specific steps will vary depending on which headless CMS you’re using, but here are some common steps you could take.\n\nThese steps assume that the headless CMS you’re using supports setting **custom preview URLs**. If it doesn’t, you can still use this method to secure your preview URLs, but you’ll need to construct and access the preview URL manually.\n\n**First**, you should create a **secret token string** using a token generator of your choice. This secret will only be known by your Next.js app and your headless CMS. This secret prevents people who don’t have access to your CMS from accessing preview URLs.\n\n**Second**, if your headless CMS supports setting custom preview URLs, specify the following as the preview URL. This assumes that your preview API route is located at `pages/api/preview.js`.\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nhttps://<your-site>/api/preview?secret=<token>&slug=<path>\n```\n\n- `<your-site>` should be your deployment domain.\n- `<token>` should be replaced with the secret token you generated.\n- `<path>` should be the path for the page that you want to preview. If you want to preview `/posts/foo`, then you should use `&slug=/posts/foo`.\n\nYour headless CMS might allow you to include a variable in the preview URL so that `<path>` can be set dynamically based on the CMS’s data like so: `&slug=/posts/{entry.fields.slug}`\n\n**Finally**, in the preview API route:\n\n- Check that the secret matches and that the `slug` parameter exists (if not, the request should fail).\n-\n- Call `res.setPreviewData`.\n- Then redirect the browser to the path specified by `slug`. (The following example uses a [307 redirect](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/307)).\n\n```js\nexport default async (req, res) => {\n  // Check the secret and next parameters\n  // This secret should only be known to this API route and the CMS\n  if (req.query.secret !== 'MY_SECRET_TOKEN' || !req.query.slug) {\n    return res.status(401).json({ message: 'Invalid token' })\n  }\n\n  // Fetch the headless CMS to check if the provided `slug` exists\n  // getPostBySlug would implement the required fetching logic to the headless CMS\n  const post = await getPostBySlug(req.query.slug)\n\n  // If the slug doesn't exist prevent preview mode from being enabled\n  if (!post) {\n    return res.status(401).json({ message: 'Invalid slug' })\n  }\n\n  // Enable Preview Mode by setting the cookies\n  res.setPreviewData({})\n\n  // Redirect to the path from the fetched post\n  // We don't redirect to req.query.slug as that might lead to open redirect vulnerabilities\n  res.redirect(post.slug)\n}\n```\n\nIf it succeeds, then the browser will be redirected to the path you want to preview with the preview mode cookies being set.\n\n## Step 2: Update `getStaticProps`\n\nThe next step is to update `getStaticProps` to support the preview mode.\n\nIf you request a page which has `getStaticProps` with the preview mode cookies set (via `res.setPreviewData`), then `getStaticProps` will be called at **request time** (instead of at build time).\n\nFurthermore, it will be called with a `context` object where:\n\n- `context.preview` will be `true`.\n- `context.previewData` will be the same as the argument used for `setPreviewData`.\n\n```js\nexport async function getStaticProps(context) {\n  // If you request this page with the preview mode cookies set:\n  //\n  // - context.preview will be true\n  // - context.previewData will be the same as\n  //   the argument used for `setPreviewData`.\n}\n```\n\nWe used `res.setPreviewData({})` in the preview API route, so `context.previewData` will be `{}`. You can use this to pass session information from the preview API route to `getStaticProps` if necessary.\n\nIf you’re also using `getStaticPaths`, then `context.params` will also be available.\n\n### Fetch preview data\n\nYou can update `getStaticProps` to fetch different data based on `context.preview` and/or `context.previewData`.\n\nFor example, your headless CMS might have a different API endpoint for draft posts. If so, you can use `context.preview` to modify the API endpoint URL like below:\n\n```js\nexport async function getStaticProps(context) {\n  // If context.preview is true, append \"/preview\" to the API endpoint\n  // to request draft data instead of published data. This will vary\n  // based on which headless CMS you're using.\n  const res = await fetch(`https://.../${context.preview ? 'preview' : ''}`)\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\nThat’s it! If you access the preview API route (with `secret` and `slug`) from your headless CMS or manually, you should now be able to see the preview content. And if you update your draft without publishing, you should be able to preview the draft.\n\nSet this as the preview URL on your headless CMS or access manually, and you should be able to see the preview.\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nhttps://<your-site>/api/preview?secret=<token>&slug=<path>\n```\n\n## More Details\n\n> **Good to know**: during rendering `next/router` exposes an `isPreview` flag, see the [router object docs](/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/use-router#router-object) for more info.\n\n### Specify the Preview Mode duration\n\n`setPreviewData` takes an optional second parameter which should be an options object. It accepts the following keys:\n\n- `maxAge`: Specifies the number (in seconds) for the preview session to last for.\n- `path`: Specifies the path the cookie should be applied under. Defaults to `/` enabling preview mode for all paths.\n\n```js\nsetPreviewData(data, {\n  maxAge: 60 * 60, // The preview mode cookies expire in 1 hour\n  path: '/about', // The preview mode cookies apply to paths with /about\n})\n```\n\n### Clear the Preview Mode cookies\n\nBy default, no expiration date is set for Preview Mode cookies, so the preview session ends when the browser is closed.\n\nTo clear the Preview Mode cookies manually, create an API route that calls `clearPreviewData()`:\n\n```js filename=\"pages/api/clear-preview-mode-cookies.js\"\nexport default function handler(req, res) {\n  res.clearPreviewData({})\n}\n```\n\nThen, send a request to `/api/clear-preview-mode-cookies` to invoke the API Route. If calling this route using [`next/link`](/docs/pages/api-reference/components/link), you must pass `prefetch={false}` to prevent calling `clearPreviewData` during link prefetching.\n\nIf a path was specified in the `setPreviewData` call, you must pass the same path to `clearPreviewData`:\n\n```js filename=\"pages/api/clear-preview-mode-cookies.js\"\nexport default function handler(req, res) {\n  const { path } = req.query\n\n  res.clearPreviewData({ path })\n}\n```\n\n### `previewData` size limits\n\nYou can pass an object to `setPreviewData` and have it be available in `getStaticProps`. However, because the data will be stored in a cookie, there’s a size limitation. Currently, preview data is limited to 2KB.\n\n### Works with `getServerSideProps`\n\nThe preview mode works on `getServerSideProps` as well. It will also be available on the `context` object containing `preview` and `previewData`.\n\n> **Good to know**: You shouldn't set the `Cache-Control` header when using Preview Mode because it cannot be bypassed. Instead, we recommend using [ISR](/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/incremental-static-regeneration).\n\n### Works with API Routes\n\nAPI Routes will have access to `preview` and `previewData` under the request object. For example:\n\n```js\nexport default function myApiRoute(req, res) {\n  const isPreview = req.preview\n  const previewData = req.previewData\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n### Unique per `next build`\n\nBoth the bypass cookie value and the private key for encrypting the `previewData` change when `next build` is completed.\nThis ensures that the bypass cookie can’t be guessed.\n\n> **Good to know**: To test Preview Mode locally over HTTP your browser will need to allow third-party cookies and local storage access.\n"},{"path":"docs/03-pages/01-building-your-application/06-configuring/10-custom-server.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/03-pages/01-building-your-application/06-configuring/10-custom-server.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/custom-server","sha":"6335b520ee50e72de7a73358d41601072a0a51f9","size":5898,"content":"---\ntitle: Custom Server\ndescription: Start a Next.js app programmatically using a custom server.\n---\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Examples</summary>\n\n- [Custom Server](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/custom-server)\n- [SSR Caching](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/ssr-caching)\n\n</details>\n\nBy default, Next.js includes its own server with `next start`. If you have an existing backend, you can still use it with Next.js (this is not a custom server). A custom Next.js server allows you to start a server 100% programmatically in order to use custom server patterns. Most of the time, you will not need this - but it's available for complete customization.\n\n> **Good to know**:\n>\n> - Before deciding to use a custom server, please keep in mind that it should only be used when the integrated router of Next.js can't meet your app requirements. A custom server will remove important performance optimizations, like **serverless functions** and **[Automatic Static Optimization](/docs/pages/building-your-application/rendering/automatic-static-optimization).**\n> - A custom server **cannot** be deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/solutions/nextjs).\n> - Standalone output mode, does not trace custom server files and this mode outputs a separate minimal `server.js` file instead.\n\nTake a look at the following example of a custom server:\n\n```js filename=\"server.js\"\nconst { createServer } = require('http')\nconst { parse } = require('url')\nconst next = require('next')\n\nconst dev = process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'\nconst hostname = 'localhost'\nconst port = 3000\n// when using middleware `hostname` and `port` must be provided below\nconst app = next({ dev, hostname, port })\nconst handle = app.getRequestHandler()\n\napp.prepare().then(() => {\n  createServer(async (req, res) => {\n    try {\n      // Be sure to pass `true` as the second argument to `url.parse`.\n      // This tells it to parse the query portion of the URL.\n      const parsedUrl = parse(req.url, true)\n      const { pathname, query } = parsedUrl\n\n      if (pathname === '/a') {\n        await app.render(req, res, '/a', query)\n      } else if (pathname === '/b') {\n        await app.render(req, res, '/b', query)\n      } else {\n        await handle(req, res, parsedUrl)\n      }\n    } catch (err) {\n      console.error('Error occurred handling', req.url, err)\n      res.statusCode = 500\n      res.end('internal server error')\n    }\n  })\n    .once('error', (err) => {\n      console.error(err)\n      process.exit(1)\n    })\n    .listen(port, () => {\n      console.log(`> Ready on http://${hostname}:${port}`)\n    })\n})\n```\n\n> `server.js` doesn't go through babel or webpack. Make sure the syntax and sources this file requires are compatible with the current node version you are running.\n\nTo run the custom server you'll need to update the `scripts` in `package.json` like so:\n\n```json filename=\"package.json\"\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"dev\": \"node server.js\",\n    \"build\": \"next build\",\n    \"start\": \"NODE_ENV=production node server.js\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\nThe custom server uses the following import to connect the server with the Next.js application:\n\n```js\nconst next = require('next')\nconst app = next({})\n```\n\nThe above `next` import is a function that receives an object with the following options:\n\n| Option         | Type               | Description                                                                                                   |\n| -------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `conf`         | `Object`           | The same object you would use in [next.config.js](/docs/pages/api-reference/next-config-js). Defaults to `{}` |\n| `customServer` | `Boolean`          | (_Optional_) Set to false when the server was created by Next.js                                              |\n| `dev`          | `Boolean`          | (_Optional_) Whether or not to launch Next.js in dev mode. Defaults to `false`                                |\n| `dir`          | `String`           | (_Optional_) Location of the Next.js project. Defaults to `'.'`                                               |\n| `quiet`        | `Boolean`          | (_Optional_) Hide error messages containing server information. Defaults to `false`                           |\n| `hostname`     | `String`           | (_Optional_) The hostname the server is running behind                                                        |\n| `port`         | `Number`           | (_Optional_) The port the server is running behind                                                            |\n| `httpServer`   | `node:http#Server` | (_Optional_) The HTTP Server that Next.js is running behind                                                   |\n\nThe returned `app` can then be used to let Next.js handle requests as required.\n\n## Disabling file-system routing\n\nBy default, `Next` will serve each file in the `pages` folder under a pathname matching the filename. If your project uses a custom server, this behavior may result in the same content being served from multiple paths, which can present problems with SEO and UX.\n\nTo disable this behavior and prevent routing based on files in `pages`, open `next.config.js` and disable the `useFileSystemPublicRoutes` config:\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  useFileSystemPublicRoutes: false,\n}\n```\n\n> Note that `useFileSystemPublicRoutes` disables filename routes from SSR; client-side routing may still access those paths. When using this option, you should guard against navigation to routes you do not want programmatically.\n\n> You may also wish to configure the client-side router to disallow client-side redirects to filename routes; for that refer to [`router.beforePopState`](/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/use-router#routerbeforepopstate).\n"},{"path":"docs/03-pages/01-building-your-application/06-configuring/09-post-css.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/03-pages/01-building-your-application/06-configuring/09-post-css.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/post-css","sha":"8e7360edb50829265d0e2e3c013cb94ebd2912f0","size":5962,"content":"---\ntitle: PostCSS\ndescription: Extend the PostCSS config and plugins added by Next.js with your own.\n---\n\n<details open>\n  <summary>Examples</summary>\n\n- [Tailwind CSS Example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-tailwindcss)\n\n</details>\n\n## Default Behavior\n\nNext.js compiles CSS for its [built-in CSS support](/docs/pages/building-your-application/styling) using PostCSS.\n\nOut of the box, with no configuration, Next.js compiles CSS with the following transformations:\n\n- [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) automatically adds vendor prefixes to CSS rules (back to IE11).\n- [Cross-browser Flexbox bugs](https://github.com/philipwalton/flexbugs) are corrected to behave like [the spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/).\n- New CSS features are automatically compiled for Internet Explorer 11 compatibility:\n  - [`all` Property](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/all)\n  - [Break Properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/break-after)\n  - [`font-variant` Property](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/font-variant)\n  - [Gap Properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/gap)\n  - [Media Query Ranges](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries#Syntax_improvements_in_Level_4)\n\nBy default, [CSS Grid](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-grid-1/) and [Custom Properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/var) (CSS variables) are **not compiled** for IE11 support.\n\nTo compile [CSS Grid Layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/grid) for IE11, you can place the following comment at the top of your CSS file:\n\n```css\n/* autoprefixer grid: autoplace */\n```\n\nYou can also enable IE11 support for [CSS Grid Layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/grid)\nin your entire project by configuring autoprefixer with the configuration shown below (collapsed).\nSee [\"Customizing Plugins\"](#customizing-plugins) below for more information.\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Click to view the configuration to enable CSS Grid Layout</summary>\n\n```json filename=\"postcss.config.json\"\n{\n  \"plugins\": [\n    \"postcss-flexbugs-fixes\",\n    [\n      \"postcss-preset-env\",\n      {\n        \"autoprefixer\": {\n          \"flexbox\": \"no-2009\",\n          \"grid\": \"autoplace\"\n        },\n        \"stage\": 3,\n        \"features\": {\n          \"custom-properties\": false\n        }\n      }\n    ]\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n</details>\n\nCSS variables are not compiled because it is [not possible to safely do so](https://github.com/MadLittleMods/postcss-css-variables#caveats).\nIf you must use variables, consider using something like [Sass variables](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/variables) which are compiled away by [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/).\n\n## Customizing Target Browsers\n\nNext.js allows you to configure the target browsers (for [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) and compiled css features) through [Browserslist](https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist).\n\nTo customize browserslist, create a `browserslist` key in your `package.json` like so:\n\n```json filename=\"package.json\"\n{\n  \"browserslist\": [\">0.3%\", \"not dead\", \"not op_mini all\"]\n}\n```\n\nYou can use the [browsersl.ist](https://browsersl.ist/?q=%3E0.3%25%2C+not+ie+11%2C+not+dead%2C+not+op_mini+all) tool to visualize what browsers you are targeting.\n\n## CSS Modules\n\nNo configuration is needed to support CSS Modules. To enable CSS Modules for a file, rename the file to have the extension `.module.css`.\n\nYou can learn more about [Next.js' CSS Module support here](/docs/pages/building-your-application/styling).\n\n## Customizing Plugins\n\n> **Warning**: When you define a custom PostCSS configuration file, Next.js **completely disables** the [default behavior](#default-behavior).\n> Be sure to manually configure all the features you need compiled, including [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer).\n> You also need to install any plugins included in your custom configuration manually, i.e. `npm install postcss-flexbugs-fixes postcss-preset-env`.\n\nTo customize the PostCSS configuration, create a `postcss.config.json` file in the root of your project.\n\nThis is the default configuration used by Next.js:\n\n```json filename=\"postcss.config.json\"\n{\n  \"plugins\": [\n    \"postcss-flexbugs-fixes\",\n    [\n      \"postcss-preset-env\",\n      {\n        \"autoprefixer\": {\n          \"flexbox\": \"no-2009\"\n        },\n        \"stage\": 3,\n        \"features\": {\n          \"custom-properties\": false\n        }\n      }\n    ]\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know**: Next.js also allows the file to be named `.postcssrc.json`, or, to be read from the `postcss` key in `package.json`.\n\nIt is also possible to configure PostCSS with a `postcss.config.js` file, which is useful when you want to conditionally include plugins based on environment:\n\n```js filename=\"postcss.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  plugins:\n    process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'\n      ? [\n          'postcss-flexbugs-fixes',\n          [\n            'postcss-preset-env',\n            {\n              autoprefixer: {\n                flexbox: 'no-2009',\n              },\n              stage: 3,\n              features: {\n                'custom-properties': false,\n              },\n            },\n          ],\n        ]\n      : [\n          // No transformations in development\n        ],\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know**: Next.js also allows the file to be named `.postcssrc.js`.\n\nDo **not use `require()`** to import the PostCSS Plugins. Plugins must be provided as strings.\n\n> **Good to know**: If your `postcss.config.js` needs to support other non-Next.js tools in the same project, you must use the interoperable object-based format instead:\n>\n> ```js\n> module.exports = {\n>   plugins: {\n>     'postcss-flexbugs-fixes': {},\n>     'postcss-preset-env': {\n>       autoprefixer: {\n>         flexbox: 'no-2009',\n>       },\n>       stage: 3,\n>       features: {\n>         'custom-properties': false,\n>       },\n>     },\n>   },\n> }\n> ```\n"},{"path":"docs/03-pages/01-building-your-application/06-configuring/index.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/03-pages/01-building-your-application/06-configuring/index.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring","sha":"c903a16a3323310dd6af63e5a32ddc6274692040","size":468,"content":"---\ntitle: Configuring\ndescription: Learn how to configure your Next.js application.\nsource: app/building-your-application/configuring\n---\n\n{/* DO NOT EDIT.

You can learn how it works with Pages Router.\n---\n\nIn the [Pages documentation](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts) and the [Data Fetching documentation](/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching), we talked about how to pre-render a page at build time (**Static Generation**) using `getStaticProps` and `getStaticPaths`.\n\nStatic Generation is useful when your pages fetch data from a headless CMS. However, it’s not ideal when you’re writing a draft on your headless CMS and want to view the draft immediately on your page. You’d want Next.js to render these pages at **request time** instead of build time and fetch the draft content instead of the published content. You’d want Next.js to bypass Static Generation only for this specific case.\n\nNext.js has a feature called **Draft Mode** which solves this problem. Here are instructions on how to use it.\n\n## Step 1: Create and access the API route\n\n> Take a look at the [API Routes documentation](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) first if you’re not familiar with Next.js API Routes.\n\nFirst, create the **API route**. It can have any name - e.g. `pages/api/draft.ts`\n\nIn this API route, you need to call `setDraftMode` on the response object.\n\n```js\nexport default function handler(req, res) {\n  // ...\n  res.setDraftMode({ enable: true })\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\nThis will set a **cookie** to enable draft mode. Subsequent requests containing this cookie will trigger **Draft Mode** changing the behavior for statically generated pages (more on this later).\n\nYou can test this manually by creating an API route like below and accessing it from your browser manually:\n\n```ts filename=\"pages/api/draft.ts\"\n// simple example for testing it manually from your browser.\nexport default function handler(req, res) {\n  res.setDraftMode({ enable: true })\n  res.end('Draft mode is enabled')\n}\n```\n\nIf you open your browser’s developer tools and visit `/api/draft`, you’ll notice a `Set-Cookie` response header with a cookie named `__prerender_bypass`.\n\n### Securely accessing it from your Headless CMS\n\nIn practice, you’d want to call this API route _securely_ from your headless CMS. The specific steps will vary depending on which headless CMS you’re using, but here are some common steps you could take.\n\nThese steps assume that the headless CMS you’re using supports setting **custom draft URLs**. If it doesn’t, you can still use this method to secure your draft URLs, but you’ll need to construct and access the draft URL manually.\n\n**First**, you should create a **secret token string** using a token generator of your choice. This secret will only be known by your Next.js app and your headless CMS. This secret prevents people who don’t have access to your CMS from accessing draft URLs.\n\n**Second**, if your headless CMS supports setting custom draft URLs, specify the following as the draft URL. This assumes that your draft API route is located at `pages/api/draft.ts`.\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nhttps://<your-site>/api/draft?secret=<token>&slug=<path>\n```\n\n- `<your-site>` should be your deployment domain.\n- `<token>` should be replaced with the secret token you generated.\n- `<path>` should be the path for the page that you want to view. If you want to view `/posts/foo`, then you should use `&slug=/posts/foo`.\n\nYour headless CMS might allow you to include a variable in the draft URL so that `<path>` can be set dynamically based on the CMS’s data like so: `&slug=/posts/{entry.fields.slug}`\n\n**Finally**, in the draft API route:\n\n- Check that the secret matches and that the `slug` parameter exists (if not, the request should fail).\n-\n- Call `res.setDraftMode`.\n- Then redirect the browser to the path specified by `slug`. (The following example uses a [307 redirect](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/307)).\n\n```js\nexport default async (req, res) => {\n  // Check the secret and next parameters\n  // This secret should only be known to this API route and the CMS\n  if (req.query.secret !== 'MY_SECRET_TOKEN' || !req.query.slug) {\n    return res.status(401).json({ message: 'Invalid token' })\n  }\n\n  // Fetch the headless CMS to check if the provided `slug` exists\n  // getPostBySlug would implement the required fetching logic to the headless CMS\n  const post = await getPostBySlug(req.query.slug)\n\n  // If the slug doesn't exist prevent draft mode from being enabled\n  if (!post) {\n    return res.status(401).json({ message: 'Invalid slug' })\n  }\n\n  // Enable Draft Mode by setting the cookie\n  res.setDraftMode({ enable: true })\n\n  // Redirect to the path from the fetched post\n  // We don't redirect to req.query.slug as that might lead to open redirect vulnerabilities\n  res.redirect(post.slug)\n}\n```\n\nIf it succeeds, then the browser will be redirected to the path you want to view with the draft mode cookie.\n\n## Step 2: Update `getStaticProps`\n\nThe next step is to update `getStaticProps` to support draft mode.\n\nIf you request a page which has `getStaticProps` with the cookie set (via `res.setDraftMode`), then `getStaticProps` will be called at **request time** (instead of at build time).\n\nFurthermore, it will be called with a `context` object where `context.draftMode` will be `true`.\n\n```js\nexport async function getStaticProps(context) {\n  if (context.draftMode) {\n    // dynamic data\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWe used `res.setDraftMode` in the draft API route, so `context.draftMode` will be `true`.\n\nIf you’re also using `getStaticPaths`, then `context.params` will also be available.\n\n### Fetch draft data\n\nYou can update `getStaticProps` to fetch different data based on `context.draftMode`.\n\nFor example, your headless CMS might have a different API endpoint for draft posts. If so, you can modify the API endpoint URL like below:\n\n```js\nexport async function getStaticProps(context) {\n  const url = context.draftMode\n    ? 'https://draft.example.com'\n    : 'https://production.example.com'\n  const res = await fetch(url)\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\nThat’s it! If you access the draft API route (with `secret` and `slug`) from your headless CMS or manually, you should now be able to see the draft content. And if you update your draft without publishing, you should be able to view the draft.\n\nSet this as the draft URL on your headless CMS or access manually, and you should be able to see the draft.\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nhttps://<your-site>/api/draft?secret=<token>&slug=<path>\n```\n\n## More Details\n\n### Clear the Draft Mode cookie\n\nBy default, the Draft Mode session ends when the browser is closed.\n\nTo clear the Draft Mode cookie manually, create an API route that calls `setDraftMode({ enable: false })`:\n\n```ts filename=\"pages/api/disable-draft.ts\"\nexport default function handler(req, res) {\n  res.setDraftMode({ enable: false })\n}\n```\n\nThen, send a request to `/api/disable-draft` to invoke the API Route. If calling this route using [`next/link`](/docs/pages/api-reference/components/link), you must pass `prefetch={false}` to prevent accidentally deleting the cookie on prefetch.\n\n### Works with `getServerSideProps`\n\nDraft Mode works with `getServerSideProps`, and is available as a `draftMode` key in the [`context`](/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/get-server-side-props#context-parameter) object.\n\n> **Good to know**: You shouldn't set the `Cache-Control` header when using Draft Mode because it cannot be bypassed. Instead, we recommend using [ISR](/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/incremental-static-regeneration).\n\n### Works with API Routes\n\nAPI Routes will have access to `draftMode` on the request object. For example:\n\n```js\nexport default function myApiRoute(req, res) {\n  if (req.draftMode) {\n    // get draft data\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Unique per `next build`\n\nA new bypass cookie value will be generated each time you run `next build`.\n\nThis ensures that the bypass cookie can’t be guessed.\n\n> **Good to know**: To test Draft Mode locally over HTTP, your browser will need to allow third-party cookies and local storage access.\n"},{"path":"docs/03-pages/01-building-your-application/06-configuring/13-debugging.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/03-pages/01-building-your-application/06-configuring/13-debugging.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/debugging","sha":"915fd735209c728a8cb1abb06376c994cc76bff8","size":6799,"content":"---\ntitle: Debugging\ndescription: Learn how to debug your Next.js application with VS Code or Chrome DevTools.\n---\n\nThis documentation explains how you can debug your Next.js frontend and backend code with full source maps support using either the [VS Code debugger](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging) or [Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools).\n\nAny debugger that can attach to Node.js can also be used to debug a Next.js application. You can find more details in the Node.js [Debugging Guide](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/debugging-getting-started/).\n\n## Debugging with VS Code\n\nCreate a file named `.vscode/launch.json` at the root of your project with the following content:\n\n```json filename=\"launch.json\"\n{\n  \"version\": \"0.2.0\",\n  \"configurations\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Next.js: debug server-side\",\n      \"type\": \"node-terminal\",\n      \"request\": \"launch\",\n      \"command\": \"npm run dev\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Next.js: debug client-side\",\n      \"type\": \"chrome\",\n      \"request\": \"launch\",\n      \"url\": \"http://localhost:3000\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Next.js: debug full stack\",\n      \"type\": \"node\",\n      \"request\": \"launch\",\n      \"program\": \"${workspaceFolder}/node_modules/.bin/next\",\n      \"runtimeArgs\": [\"--inspect\"],\n      \"skipFiles\": [\"<node_internals>/**\"],\n      \"serverReadyAction\": {\n        \"action\": \"debugWithEdge\",\n        \"killOnServerStop\": true,\n        \"pattern\": \"- Local:.+(https?://.+)\",\n        \"uriFormat\": \"%s\",\n        \"webRoot\": \"${workspaceFolder}\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n`npm run dev` can be replaced with `yarn dev` if you're using Yarn or `pnpm dev` if you're using pnpm.\n\nIf you're [changing the port number](/docs/pages/api-reference/next-cli#development) your application starts on, replace the `3000` in `http://localhost:3000` with the port you're using instead.\n\nIf you're running Next.js from a directory other than root (for example, if you're using Turborepo) then you need to add `cwd` to the server-side and full stack debugging tasks. For example, `\"cwd\": \"${workspaceFolder}/apps/web\"`.\n\nNow go to the Debug panel (`Ctrl+Shift+D` on Windows/Linux, `⇧+⌘+D` on macOS), select a launch configuration, then press `F5` or select **Debug: Start Debugging** from the Command Palette to start your debugging session.\n\n## Using the Debugger in Jetbrains WebStorm\n\nClick the drop down menu listing the runtime configuration, and click `Edit Configurations...`. Create a `Javascript Debug` debug configuration with `http://localhost:3000` as the URL. Customize to your liking (e.g. Browser for debugging, store as project file), and click `OK`. Run this debug configuration, and the selected browser should automatically open. At this point, you should have 2 applications in debug mode: the NextJS node application, and the client/ browser application.\n\n## Debugging with Chrome DevTools\n\n### Client-side code\n\nStart your development server as usual by running `next dev`, `npm run dev`, or `yarn dev`. Once the server starts, open `http://localhost:3000` (or your alternate URL) in Chrome. Next, open Chrome's Developer Tools (`Ctrl+Shift+J` on Windows/Linux, `⌥+⌘+I` on macOS), then go to the **Sources** tab.\n\nNow, any time your client-side code reaches a [`debugger`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/debugger) statement, code execution will pause and that file will appear in the debug area. You can also press `Ctrl+P` on Windows/Linux or `⌘+P` on macOS to search for a file and set breakpoints manually. Note that when searching here, your source files will have paths starting with `webpack://_N_E/./`.\n\n### Server-side code\n\nTo debug server-side Next.js code with Chrome DevTools, you need to pass the [`--inspect`](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#cli_inspect_host_port) flag to the underlying Node.js process:\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nNODE_OPTIONS='--inspect' next dev\n```\n\nIf you're using `npm run dev` or `yarn dev` then you should update the `dev` script on your `package.json`:\n\n```json filename=\"package.json\"\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"dev\": \"NODE_OPTIONS='--inspect' next dev\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nLaunching the Next.js dev server with the `--inspect` flag will look something like this:\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nDebugger listening on ws://127.0.0.1:9229/0cf90313-350d-4466-a748-cd60f4e47c95\nFor help, see: https://nodejs.org/en/docs/inspector\nready - started server on 0.0.0.0:3000, url: http://localhost:3000\n```\n\n> Be aware that running `NODE_OPTIONS='--inspect' npm run dev` or `NODE_OPTIONS='--inspect' yarn dev` won't work. This would try to start multiple debuggers on the same port: one for the npm/yarn process and one for Next.js. You would then get an error like `Starting inspector on 127.0.0.1:9229 failed: address already in use` in your console.\n\nOnce the server starts, open a new tab in Chrome and visit `chrome://inspect`, where you should see your Next.js application inside the **Remote Target** section. Click **inspect** under your application to open a separate DevTools window, then go to the **Sources** tab.\n\nDebugging server-side code here works much like debugging client-side code with Chrome DevTools, except that when you search for files here with `Ctrl+P` or `⌘+P`, your source files will have paths starting with `webpack://{application-name}/./` (where `{application-name}` will be replaced with the name of your application according to your `package.json` file).\n\n### Debugging on Windows\n\nWindows users may run into an issue when using `NODE_OPTIONS='--inspect'` as that syntax is not supported on Windows platforms. To get around this, install the [`cross-env`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cross-env) package as a development dependency (`-D` with `npm` and `yarn`) and replace the `dev` script with the following.\n\n```json filename=\"package.json\"\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"dev\": \"cross-env NODE_OPTIONS='--inspect' next dev\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n`cross-env` will set the `NODE_OPTIONS` environment variable regardless of which platform you are on (including Mac, Linux, and Windows) and allow you to debug consistently across devices and operating systems.\n\n> **Good to know**: Ensure Windows Defender is disabled on your machine. This external service will check _every file read_, which has been reported to greatly increase Fast Refresh time with `next dev`. This is a known issue, not related to Next.js, but it does affect Next.js development.\n\n## More information\n\nTo learn more about how to use a JavaScript debugger, take a look at the following documentation:\n\n- [Node.js debugging in VS Code: Breakpoints](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/nodejs-debugging#_breakpoints)\n- [Chrome DevTools: Debug JavaScript](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/javascript)\n"},{"path":"docs/03-pages/01-building-your-application/06-configuring/07-amp.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/03-pages/01-building-your-application/06-configuring/07-amp.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/amp","sha":"e87394a636401e98e111e34b7c750f0257e6161e","size":4656,"content":"---\ntitle: AMP\ndescription: With minimal config, and without leaving React, you can start adding AMP and improve the performance and speed of your pages.\n---\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Examples</summary>\n  \n- [AMP](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/amp)\n\n</details>\n\nWith Next.js you can turn any React page into an AMP page, with minimal config, and without leaving React.\n\nYou can read more about AMP in the official [amp.dev](https://amp.dev/) site.\n\n## Enabling AMP\n\nTo enable AMP support for a page, and to learn more about the different AMP configs, read the [API documentation for `next/amp`](/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/amp).\n\n## Caveats\n\n- Only CSS-in-JS is supported. [CSS Modules](/docs/pages/building-your-application/styling) aren't supported by AMP pages at the moment. You can [contribute CSS Modules support to Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/10549).\n\n## Adding AMP Components\n\nThe AMP community provides [many components](https://amp.dev/documentation/components/) to make AMP pages more interactive. Next.js will automatically import all components used on a page and there is no need to manually import AMP component scripts:\n\n```jsx\nexport const config = { amp: true }\n\nfunction MyAmpPage() {\n  const date = new Date()\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <p>Some time: {date.toJSON()}</p>\n      <amp-timeago\n        width=\"0\"\n        height=\"15\"\n        datetime={date.toJSON()}\n        layout=\"responsive\"\n      >\n        .\n      </amp-timeago>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default MyAmpPage\n```\n\nThe above example uses the [`amp-timeago`](https://amp.dev/documentation/components/amp-timeago/?format=websites) component.\n\nBy default, the latest version of a component is always imported. If you want to customize the version, you can use `next/head`, as in the following example:\n\n```jsx\nimport Head from 'next/head'\n\nexport const config = { amp: true }\n\nfunction MyAmpPage() {\n  const date = new Date()\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <Head>\n        <script\n          async\n          key=\"amp-timeago\"\n          custom-element=\"amp-timeago\"\n          src=\"https://cdn.ampproject.org/v0/amp-timeago-0.1.js\"\n        />\n      </Head>\n\n      <p>Some time: {date.toJSON()}</p>\n      <amp-timeago\n        width=\"0\"\n        height=\"15\"\n        datetime={date.toJSON()}\n        layout=\"responsive\"\n      >\n        .\n      </amp-timeago>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default MyAmpPage\n```\n\n## AMP Validation\n\nAMP pages are automatically validated with [amphtml-validator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/amphtml-validator) during development. Errors and warnings will appear in the terminal where you started Next.js.\n\nPages are also validated during [Static HTML export](/docs/pages/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports) and any warnings / errors will be printed to the terminal. Any AMP errors will cause the export to exit with status code `1` because the export is not valid AMP.\n\n### Custom Validators\n\nYou can set up custom AMP validator in `next.config.js` as shown below:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  amp: {\n    validator: './custom_validator.js',\n  },\n}\n```\n\n### Skip AMP Validation\n\nTo turn off AMP validation add the following code to `next.config.js`\n\n```js\nexperimental: {\n  amp: {\n    skipValidation: true\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### AMP in Static HTML Export\n\nWhen using [Static HTML export](/docs/pages/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports) statically prerender pages, Next.js will detect if the page supports AMP and change the exporting behavior based on that.\n\nFor example, the hybrid AMP page `pages/about.js` would output:\n\n- `out/about.html` - HTML page with client-side React runtime\n- `out/about.amp.html` - AMP page\n\nAnd if `pages/about.js` is an AMP-only page, then it would output:\n\n- `out/about.html` - Optimized AMP page\n\nNext.js will automatically insert a link to the AMP version of your page in the HTML version, so you don't have to, like so:\n\n```jsx\n<link rel=\"amphtml\" href=\"/about.amp.html\" />\n```\n\nAnd the AMP version of your page will include a link to the HTML page:\n\n```jsx\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"/about\" />\n```\n\nWhen [`trailingSlash`](/docs/pages/api-reference/next-config-js/trailingSlash) is enabled the exported pages for `pages/about.js` would be:\n\n- `out/about/index.html` - HTML page\n- `out/about.amp/index.html` - AMP page\n\n## TypeScript\n\nAMP currently doesn't have built-in types for TypeScript, but it's in their roadmap ([#13791](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/issues/13791)).\n\nAs a workaround you can manually create a file called `amp.d.ts` inside your project and add these [custom types](https://stackoverflow.com/a/50601125).\n"},{"path":"docs/03-pages/02-api-reference/index.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/03-pages/02-api-reference/index.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference","sha":"59ed768249f9262f6a13f4cf61ed74d4a06c3a94","size":86,"content":"---\ntitle: API Reference\ndescription: Next.js API Reference for the Pages Router.\n---\n"},{"path":"docs/03-pages/02-api-reference/04-create-next-app.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/03-pages/02-api-reference/04-create-next-app.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/create-next-app","sha":"526b85f346219f8e49f6fbe560fa20125c27440e","size":431,"content":"---\ntitle: create-next-app\ndescription: create-next-app\nsource: app/api-reference/create-next-app\n---\n\n{/* DO NOT EDIT.

In order to provide a backwards compatible upgrade solution, the old `next/image` was renamed to `next/legacy/image`.\n\nView the **new** [`next/image` API Reference](/docs/pages/api-reference/components/image)\n\n## Comparison\n\nCompared to `next/legacy/image`, the new `next/image` component has the following changes:\n\n- Removes `<span>` wrapper around `<img>` in favor of [native computed aspect ratio](https://caniuse.com/mdn-html_elements_img_aspect_ratio_computed_from_attributes)\n- Adds support for canonical `style` prop\n  - Removes `layout` prop in favor of `style` or `className`\n  - Removes `objectFit` prop in favor of `style` or `className`\n  - Removes `objectPosition` prop in favor of `style` or `className`\n- Removes `IntersectionObserver` implementation in favor of [native lazy loading](https://caniuse.com/loading-lazy-attr)\n  - Removes `lazyBoundary` prop since there is no native equivalent\n  - Removes `lazyRoot` prop since there is no native equivalent\n- Removes `loader` config in favor of [`loader`](#loader) prop\n- Changed `alt` prop from optional to required\n- Changed `onLoadingComplete` callback to receive reference to `<img>` element\n\n## Required Props\n\nThe `<Image />` component requires the following properties.\n\n### src\n\nMust be one of the following:\n\n- A [statically imported](/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/images#local-images) image file\n- A path string. This can be either an absolute external URL, or an internal path depending on the [loader](#loader) prop or [loader configuration](#loader-configuration).\n\nWhen using an external URL, you must add it to [remotePatterns](#remote-patterns) in `next.config.js`.\n\n### width\n\nThe `width` property can represent either the _rendered_ width or _original_ width in pixels, depending on the [`layout`](#layout) and [`sizes`](#sizes) properties.\n\nWhen using `layout=\"intrinsic\"` or `layout=\"fixed\"` the `width` property represents the _rendered_ width in pixels, so it will affect how large the image appears.\n\nWhen using `layout=\"responsive\"`, `layout=\"fill\"`, the `width` property represents the _original_ width in pixels, so it will only affect the aspect ratio.\n\nThe `width` property is required, except for [statically imported images](/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/images#local-images), or those with `layout=\"fill\"`.\n\n### height\n\nThe `height` property can represent either the _rendered_ height or _original_ height in pixels, depending on the [`layout`](#layout) and [`sizes`](#sizes) properties.\n\nWhen using `layout=\"intrinsic\"` or `layout=\"fixed\"` the `height` property represents the _rendered_ height in pixels, so it will affect how large the image appears.\n\nWhen using `layout=\"responsive\"`, `layout=\"fill\"`, the `height` property represents the _original_ height in pixels, so it will only affect the aspect ratio.\n\nThe `height` property is required, except for [statically imported images](/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/images#local-images), or those with `layout=\"fill\"`.\n\n## Optional Props\n\nThe `<Image />` component accepts a number of additional properties beyond those which are required.

Setting the loader as a prop on the Image component overrides the default loader defined in the [`images` section of `next.config.js`](#loader-configuration).\n\nA `loader` is a function returning a URL string for the image, given the following parameters:\n\n- [`src`](#src)\n- [`width`](#width)\n- [`quality`](#quality)\n\nHere is an example of using a custom loader:\n\n```js\nimport Image from 'next/legacy/image'\n\nconst myLoader = ({ src, width, quality }) => {\n  return `https://example.com/${src}?w=${width}&q=${quality || 75}`\n}\n\nconst MyImage = (props) => {\n  return (\n    <Image\n      loader={myLoader}\n      src=\"me.png\"\n      alt=\"Picture of the author\"\n      width={500}\n      height={500}\n    />\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### sizes\n\nA string that provides information about how wide the image will be at different breakpoints. The value of `sizes` will greatly affect performance for images using `layout=\"responsive\"` or `layout=\"fill\"`. It will be ignored for images using `layout=\"intrinsic\"` or `layout=\"fixed\"`.\n\nThe `sizes` property serves two important purposes related to image performance:\n\nFirst, the value of `sizes` is used by the browser to determine which size of the image to download, from `next/legacy/image`'s automatically-generated source set. When the browser chooses, it does not yet know the size of the image on the page, so it selects an image that is the same size or larger than the viewport. The `sizes` property allows you to tell the browser that the image will actually be smaller than full screen. If you don't specify a `sizes` value, a default value of `100vw` (full screen width) is used.\n\nSecond, the `sizes` value is parsed and used to trim the values in the automatically-created source set. If the `sizes` property includes sizes such as `50vw`, which represent a percentage of the viewport width, then the source set is trimmed to not include any values which are too small to ever be necessary.\n\nFor example, if you know your styling will cause an image to be full-width on mobile devices, in a 2-column layout on tablets, and a 3-column layout on desktop displays, you should include a sizes property such as the following:\n\n```js\nimport Image from 'next/legacy/image'\nconst Example = () => (\n  <div className=\"grid-element\">\n    <Image\n      src=\"/example.png\"\n      layout=\"fill\"\n      sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw,\n              (max-width: 1200px) 50vw,\n              33vw\"\n    />\n  </div>\n)\n```\n\nThis example `sizes` could have a dramatic effect on performance metrics. Without the `33vw` sizes, the image selected from the server would be 3 times as wide as it needs to be. Because file size is proportional to the square of the width, without `sizes` the user would download an image that's 9 times larger than necessary.\n\nLearn more about `srcset` and `sizes`:\n\n- [web.dev](https://web.dev/learn/design/responsive-images/#sizes)\n- [mdn](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img#attr-sizes)\n\n### quality\n\nThe quality of the optimized image, an integer between `1` and `100` where `100` is the best quality. Defaults to `75`.\n\n### priority\n\nWhen true, the image will be considered high priority and\n[preload](https://web.dev/preload-responsive-images/). Lazy loading is automatically disabled for images using `priority`.\n\nYou should use the `priority` property on any image detected as the [Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)](https://nextjs.org/learn/seo/web-performance/lcp) element. It may be appropriate to have multiple priority images, as different images may be the LCP element for different viewport sizes.\n\nShould only be used when the image is visible above the fold. Defaults to `false`.\n\n### placeholder\n\nA placeholder to use while the image is loading. Possible values are `blur` or `empty`. Defaults to `empty`.\n\nWhen `blur`, the [`blurDataURL`](#blurdataurl) property will be used as the placeholder. If `src` is an object from a [static import](/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/images#local-images) and the imported image is `.jpg`, `.png`, `.webp`, or `.avif`, then `blurDataURL` will be automatically populated.\n\nFor dynamic images, you must provide the [`blurDataURL`](#blurdataurl) property. Solutions such as [Plaiceholder](https://github.com/joe-bell/plaiceholder) can help with `base64` generation.\n\nWhen `empty`, there will be no placeholder while the image is loading, only empty space.\n\nTry it out:\n\n- [Demo the `blur` placeholder](https://image-legacy-component.nextjs.gallery/placeholder)\n- [Demo the shimmer effect with `blurDataURL` prop](https://image-legacy-component.nextjs.gallery/shimmer)\n- [Demo the color effect with `blurDataURL` prop](https://image-legacy-component.nextjs.gallery/color)\n\n## Advanced Props\n\nIn some cases, you may need more advanced usage. The `<Image />` component optionally accepts the following advanced properties.\n\n### style\n\nAllows [passing CSS styles](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/style) to the underlying image element.\n\nNote that all `layout` modes apply their own styles to the image element, and these automatic styles take precedence over the `style` prop.\n\nAlso keep in mind that the required `width` and `height` props can interact with your styling. If you use styling to modify an image's `width`, you must set the `height=\"auto\"` style as well, or your image will be distorted.\n\n### objectFit\n\nDefines how the image will fit into its parent container when using `layout=\"fill\"`.\n\nThis value is passed to the [object-fit CSS property](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/object-fit) for the `src` image.\n\n### objectPosition\n\nDefines how the image is positioned within its parent element when using `layout=\"fill\"`.\n\nThis value is passed to the [object-position CSS property](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/object-position) applied to the image.\n\n### onLoadingComplete\n\nA callback function that is invoked once the image is completely loaded and the [placeholder](#placeholder) has been removed.\n\nThe `onLoadingComplete` function accepts one parameter, an object with the following properties:\n\n- [`naturalWidth`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/HTMLImageElement/naturalWidth)\n- [`naturalHeight`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/HTMLImageElement/naturalHeight)\n\n### loading\n\n> **Attention**: This property is only meant for advanced usage. Switching an\n> image to load with `eager` will normally **hurt performance**.\n>\n> We recommend using the [`priority`](#priority) property instead, which\n> properly loads the image eagerly for nearly all use cases.\n\nThe loading behavior of the image. Defaults to `lazy`.\n\nWhen `lazy`, defer loading the image until it reaches a calculated distance from\nthe viewport.\n\nWhen `eager`, load the image immediately.\n\n[Learn more](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img#attr-loading)\n\n### blurDataURL\n\nA [Data URL](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Data_URIs) to\nbe used as a placeholder image before the `src` image successfully loads. Only takes effect when combined\nwith [`placeholder=\"blur\"`](#placeholder).\n\nMust be a base64-encoded image. It will be enlarged and blurred, so a very small image (10px or\nless) is recommended. Including larger images as placeholders may harm your application performance.\n\nTry it out:\n\n- [Demo the default `blurDataURL` prop](https://image-legacy-component.nextjs.gallery/placeholder)\n- [Demo the shimmer effect with `blurDataURL` prop](https://image-legacy-component.nextjs.gallery/shimmer)\n- [Demo the color effect with `blurDataURL` prop](https://image-legacy-component.nextjs.gallery/color)\n\nYou can also [generate a solid color Data URL](https://png-pixel.com) to match the image.\n\n### lazyBoundary\n\nA string (with similar syntax to the margin property) that acts as the bounding box used to detect the intersection of the viewport with the image and trigger lazy [loading](#loading). Defaults to `\"200px\"`.\n\nIf the image is nested in a scrollable parent element other than the root document, you will also need to assign the [lazyRoot](#lazyroot) prop.\n\n[Learn more](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/IntersectionObserver/rootMargin)\n\n### lazyRoot\n\nA React [Ref](https://react.dev/learn/referencing-values-with-refs) pointing to the scrollable parent element. Defaults to `null` (the document viewport).\n\nThe Ref must point to a DOM element or a React component that [forwards the Ref](https://react.dev/reference/react/forwardRef) to the underlying DOM element.\n\n**Example pointing to a DOM element**\n\n```jsx\nimport Image from 'next/legacy/image'\nimport React from 'react'\n\nconst Example = () => {\n  const lazyRoot = React.useRef(null)\n\n  return (\n    <div ref={lazyRoot} style={{ overflowX: 'scroll', width: '500px' }}>\n      <Image lazyRoot={lazyRoot} src=\"/one.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" />\n      <Image lazyRoot={lazyRoot} src=\"/two.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n**Example pointing to a React component**\n\n```jsx\nimport Image from 'next/legacy/image'\nimport React from 'react'\n\nconst Container = React.forwardRef((props, ref) => {\n  return (\n    <div ref={ref} style={{ overflowX: 'scroll', width: '500px' }}>\n      {props.children}\n    </div>\n  )\n})\n\nconst Example = () => {\n  const lazyRoot = React.useRef(null)\n\n  return (\n    <Container ref={lazyRoot}>\n      <Image lazyRoot={lazyRoot} src=\"/one.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" />\n      <Image lazyRoot={lazyRoot} src=\"/two.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" />\n    </Container>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n[Learn more](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/IntersectionObserver/root)\n\n### unoptimized\n\nWhen true, the source image will be served as-is instead of changing quality,\nsize, or format. Defaults to `false`.\n\n```js\nimport Image from 'next/image'\n\nconst UnoptimizedImage = (props) => {\n  return <Image {...props} unoptimized />\n}\n```\n\nSince Next.js 12.3.0, this prop can be assigned to all images by updating `next.config.js` with the following configuration:\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    unoptimized: true,\n  },\n}\n```\n\n## Other Props\n\nOther properties on the `<Image />` component will be passed to the underlying\n`img` element with the exception of the following:\n\n- `srcSet`. Use\n  [Device Sizes](#device-sizes)\n  instead.\n- `ref`. Use [`onLoadingComplete`](#onloadingcomplete) instead.\n- `decoding`. It is always `\"async\"`.\n\n## Configuration Options\n\n### Remote Patterns\n\nTo protect your application from malicious users, configuration is required in order to use external images. This ensures that only external images from your account can be served from the Next.js Image Optimization API. These external images can be configured with the `remotePatterns` property in your `next.config.js` file, as shown below:\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    remotePatterns: [\n      {\n        protocol: 'https',\n        hostname: 'example.com',\n        port: '',\n        pathname: '/account123/**',\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know**: The example above will ensure the `src` property of `next/legacy/image` must start with `https://example.com/account123/`. Any other protocol, hostname, port, or unmatched path will respond with 400 Bad Request.\n\nBelow is another example of the `remotePatterns` property in the `next.config.js` file:\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    remotePatterns: [\n      {\n        protocol: 'https',\n        hostname: '**.example.com',\n        port: '',\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know**: The example above will ensure the `src` property of `next/legacy/image` must start with `https://img1.example.com` or `https://me.avatar.example.com` or any number of subdomains. Any other protocol, port, or unmatched hostname will respond with 400 Bad Request.\n\nWildcard patterns can be used for both `pathname` and `hostname` and have the following syntax:\n\n- `*` match a single path segment or subdomain\n- `**` match any number of path segments at the end or subdomains at the beginning\n\nThe `**` syntax does not work in the middle of the pattern.\n\n> **Good to know**: When omitting `protocol`, `port` or `pathname`, then the wildcard `**` is implied. This is not recommended because it may allow malicious actors to optimize urls you did not intend.\n\n### Domains\n\n> **Warning**: Deprecated since Next.js 14 in favor of strict [`remotePatterns`](#remote-patterns) in order to protect your application from malicious users. Only use `domains` if you own all the content served from the domain.\n\nSimilar to [`remotePatterns`](#remote-patterns), the `domains` configuration can be used to provide a list of allowed hostnames for external images.\n\nHowever, the `domains` configuration does not support wildcard pattern matching and it cannot restrict protocol, port, or pathname.\n\nBelow is an example of the `domains` property in the `next.config.js` file:\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    domains: ['assets.acme.com'],\n  },\n}\n```\n\n### Loader Configuration\n\nIf you want to use a cloud provider to optimize images instead of using the Next.js built-in Image Optimization API, you can configure the `loader` and `path` prefix in your `next.config.js` file. This allows you to use relative URLs for the Image [`src`](#src) and automatically generate the correct absolute URL for your provider.\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    loader: 'imgix',\n    path: 'https://example.com/myaccount/',\n  },\n}\n```\n\n### Built-in Loaders\n\nThe following Image Optimization cloud providers are included:\n\n- Default: Works automatically with `next dev`, `next start`, or a custom server\n- [Vercel](https://vercel.com): Works automatically when you deploy on Vercel, no configuration necessary. [Learn more](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/image-optimization?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=next-website)\n- [Imgix](https://www.imgix.com): `loader: 'imgix'`\n- [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com): `loader: 'cloudinary'`\n- [Akamai](https://www.akamai.com): `loader: 'akamai'`\n- Custom: `loader: 'custom'` use a custom cloud provider by implementing the [`loader`](#loader) prop on the `next/legacy/image` component\n\nIf you need a different provider, you can use the [`loader`](#loader) prop with `next/legacy/image`.\n\n> Images can not be optimized at build time using [`output: 'export'`](/docs/pages/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports), only on-demand. To use `next/legacy/image` with `output: 'export'`, you will need to use a different loader than the default. [Read more in the discussion.](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/19065)\n\n## Advanced\n\nThe following configuration is for advanced use cases and is usually not necessary. If you choose to configure the properties below, you will override any changes to the Next.js defaults in future updates.\n\n### Device Sizes\n\nIf you know the expected device widths of your users, you can specify a list of device width breakpoints using the `deviceSizes` property in `next.config.js`. These widths are used when the `next/legacy/image` component uses `layout=\"responsive\"` or `layout=\"fill\"` to ensure the correct image is served for user's device.\n\nIf no configuration is provided, the default below is used.\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    deviceSizes: [640, 750, 828, 1080, 1200, 1920, 2048, 3840],\n  },\n}\n```\n\n### Image Sizes\n\nYou can specify a list of image widths using the `images.imageSizes` property in your `next.config.js` file. These widths are concatenated with the array of [device sizes](#device-sizes) to form the full array of sizes used to generate image [srcset](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/HTMLImageElement/srcset)s.\n\nThe reason there are two separate lists is that imageSizes is only used for images which provide a [`sizes`](#sizes) prop, which indicates that the image is less than the full width of the screen. **Therefore, the sizes in imageSizes should all be smaller than the smallest size in deviceSizes.**\n\nIf no configuration is provided, the default below is used.\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    imageSizes: [16, 32, 48, 64, 96, 128, 256, 384],\n  },\n}\n```\n\n### Acceptable Formats\n\nThe default [Image Optimization API](#loader-configuration) will automatically detect the browser's supported image formats via the request's `Accept` header.\n\nIf the `Accept` head matches more than one of the configured formats, the first match in the array is used. Therefore, the array order matters. If there is no match (or the source image is [animated](#animated-images)), the Image Optimization API will fallback to the original image's format.\n\nIf no configuration is provided, the default below is used.\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    formats: ['image/webp'],\n  },\n}\n```\n\nYou can enable AVIF support with the following configuration.\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    formats: ['image/avif', 'image/webp'],\n  },\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know**: AVIF generally takes 20% longer to encode but it compresses 20% smaller compared to WebP. This means that the first time an image is requested, it will typically be slower and then subsequent requests that are cached will be faster.\n\n## Caching Behavior\n\nThe following describes the caching algorithm for the default [loader](#loader). For all other loaders, please refer to your cloud provider's documentation.\n\nImages are optimized dynamically upon request and stored in the `<distDir>/cache/images` directory. The optimized image file will be served for subsequent requests until the expiration is reached. When a request is made that matches a cached but expired file, the expired image is served stale immediately. Then the image is optimized again in the background (also called revalidation) and saved to the cache with the new expiration date.\n\nThe cache status of an image can be determined by reading the value of the `x-nextjs-cache` (`x-vercel-cache` when deployed on Vercel) response header. The possible values are the following:\n\n- `MISS` - the path is not in the cache (occurs at most once, on the first visit)\n- `STALE` - the path is in the cache but exceeded the revalidate time so it will be updated in the background\n- `HIT` - the path is in the cache and has not exceeded the revalidate time\n\nThe expiration (or rather Max Age) is defined by either the [`minimumCacheTTL`](#minimum-cache-ttl) configuration or the upstream image `Cache-Control` header, whichever is larger. Specifically, the `max-age` value of the `Cache-Control` header is used. If both `s-maxage` and `max-age` are found, then `s-maxage` is preferred. The `max-age` is also passed-through to any downstream clients including CDNs and browsers.\n\n- You can configure [`minimumCacheTTL`](#minimum-cache-ttl) to increase the cache duration when the upstream image does not include `Cache-Control` header or the value is very low.\n- You can configure [`deviceSizes`](#device-sizes) and [`imageSizes`](#image-sizes) to reduce the total number of possible generated images.\n- You can configure [formats](#acceptable-formats) to disable multiple formats in favor of a single image format.\n\n### Minimum Cache TTL\n\nYou can configure the Time to Live (TTL) in seconds for cached optimized images. In many cases, it's better to use a [Static Image Import](/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/images#local-images) which will automatically hash the file contents and cache the image forever with a `Cache-Control` header of `immutable`.\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    minimumCacheTTL: 60,\n  },\n}\n```\n\nThe expiration (or rather Max Age) of the optimized image is defined by either the `minimumCacheTTL` or the upstream image `Cache-Control` header, whichever is larger.\n\nIf you need to change the caching behavior per image, you can configure [`headers`](/docs/pages/api-reference/next-config-js/headers) to set the `Cache-Control` header on the upstream image (e.g. `/some-asset.jpg`, not `/_next/image` itself).\n\nThere is no mechanism to invalidate the cache at this time, so its best to keep `minimumCacheTTL` low. Otherwise you may need to manually change the [`src`](#src) prop or delete `<distDir>/cache/images`.\n\n### Disable Static Imports\n\nThe default behavior allows you to import static files such as `import icon from './icon.png'` and then pass that to the `src` property.\n\nIn some cases, you may wish to disable this feature if it conflicts with other plugins that expect the import to behave differently.\n\nYou can disable static image imports inside your `next.config.js`:\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    disableStaticImages: true,\n  },\n}\n```\n\n### Dangerously Allow SVG\n\nThe default [loader](#loader) does not optimize SVG images for a few reasons. First, SVG is a vector format meaning it can be resized losslessly. Second, SVG has many of the same features as HTML/CSS, which can lead to vulnerabilities without proper [Content Security Policy (CSP) headers](/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/headers#content-security-policy).\n\nTherefore, we recommended using the [`unoptimized`](#unoptimized) prop when the [`src`](#src) prop is known to be SVG. This happens automatically when `src` ends with `\".svg\"`.\n\nHowever, if you need to serve SVG images with the default Image Optimization API, you can set `dangerouslyAllowSVG` inside your `next.config.js`:\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    dangerouslyAllowSVG: true,\n    contentDispositionType: 'attachment',\n    contentSecurityPolicy: \"default-src 'self'; script-src 'none'; sandbox;\",\n  },\n}\n```\n\nIn addition, it is strongly recommended to also set `contentDispositionType` to force the browser to download the image, as well as `contentSecurityPolicy` to prevent scripts embedded in the image from executing.\n\n### `contentDispositionType`\n\nThe default [loader](#loader) sets the [`Content-Disposition`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Disposition#as_a_response_header_for_the_main_body) header to `attachment` for added protection since the API can serve arbitrary remote images.\n\nThe default value is `attachment` which forces the browser to download the image when visiting directly. This is particularly important when [`dangerouslyAllowSVG`](#dangerously-allow-svg) is true.\n\nYou can optionally configure `inline` to allow the browser to render the image when visiting directly, without downloading it.\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    contentDispositionType: 'inline',\n  },\n}\n```\n\n### Animated Images\n\nThe default [loader](#loader) will automatically bypass Image Optimization for animated images and serve the image as-is.\n\nAuto-detection for animated files is best-effort and supports GIF, APNG, and WebP. If you want to explicitly bypass Image Optimization for a given animated image, use the [unoptimized](#unoptimized) prop.\n\n## Version History\n\n| Version   | Changes                                     |\n| --------- | ------------------------------------------- |\n| `v13.0.0` | `next/image` renamed to `next/legacy/image` |\n"},{"path":"docs/03-pages/02-api-reference/01-components/script.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/03-pages/02-api-reference/01-components/script.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/components/script","sha":"94f787d022cb616a99859bb0342af965aebd564c","size":511,"content":"---\ntitle: <Script>\ndescription: Optimize third-party scripts in your Next.js application using the built-in `next/script` Component.\nsource: app/api-reference/components/script\n---\n\n{/* DO NOT EDIT.

This will result in an `next-head-count is missing` error. `next/head` can only handle tags inside the HTML `<head>` tag.\n"},{"path":"docs/03-pages/02-api-reference/02-functions/get-initial-props.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/03-pages/02-api-reference/02-functions/get-initial-props.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/get-initial-props","sha":"dfab726fd17fdce9c8ab093725dcd3681bddc76b","size":3775,"content":"---\ntitle: getInitialProps\ndescription: Fetch dynamic data on the server for your React component with getInitialProps.\n---\n\n> **Good to know**: `getInitialProps` is a legacy API. We recommend using [`getStaticProps`](/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-static-props) or [`getServerSideProps`](/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-server-side-props) instead.\n\n`getInitialProps` is an `async` function that can be added to the default exported React component for the page. It will run on both the server-side and again on the client-side during page transitions. The result of the function will be forwarded to the React component as `props`.\n\n```tsx filename=\"pages/index.tsx\" switcher\nimport { NextPageContext } from 'next'\n\nPage.getInitialProps = async (ctx: NextPageContext) => {\n  const res = await fetch('https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js')\n  const json = await res.json()\n  return { stars: json.stargazers_count }\n}\n\nexport default function Page({ stars }: { stars: number }) {\n  return stars\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"pages/index.js\" switcher\nPage.getInitialProps = async (ctx) => {\n  const res = await fetch('https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js')\n  const json = await res.json()\n  return { stars: json.stargazers_count }\n}\n\nexport default function Page({ stars }) {\n  return stars\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know**:\n>\n> - Data returned from `getInitialProps` is serialized when server rendering. Ensure the returned object from `getInitialProps` is a plain `Object`, and not using `Date`, `Map` or `Set`.\n> - For the initial page load, `getInitialProps` will run on the server only. `getInitialProps` will then also run on the client when navigating to a different route with the [`next/link`](/docs/pages/api-reference/components/link) component or by using [`next/router`](/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/use-router).\n> - If `getInitialProps` is used in a custom `_app.js`, and the page being navigated to is using `getServerSideProps`, then `getInitialProps` will also run on the server.\n\n## Context Object\n\n`getInitialProps` receives a single argument called `context`, which is an object with the following properties:\n\n| Name       | Description                                                                                           |\n| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `pathname` | Current route, the path of the page in `/pages`                                                       |\n| `query`    | Query string of the URL, parsed as an object                                                          |\n| `asPath`   | `String` of the actual path (including the query) shown in the browser                                |\n| `req`      | [HTTP request object](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_incomingmessage) (server only) |\n| `res`      | [HTTP response object](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_serverresponse) (server only) |\n| `err`      | Error object if any error is encountered during the rendering                                         |\n\n## Caveats\n\n- `getInitialProps` can only be used in `pages/` top level files, and not in nested components. To have nested data fetching at the component level, consider exploring the [App Router](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching).\n- Regardless of whether your route is static or dynamic, any data returned from `getInitialProps` as `props` will be able to be examined on the client-side in the initial HTML. This is to allow the page to be [hydrated](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/hydrate) correctly. Make sure that you don't pass any sensitive information that shouldn't be available on the client in `props`.\n"},{"path":"docs/03-pages/02-api-reference/02-functions/get-server-side-props.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/03-pages/02-api-reference/02-functions/get-server-side-props.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/get-server-side-props","sha":"c88811863e1127eb5bd29d362dfd6f45e0f929c3","size":7665,"content":"---\ntitle: getServerSideProps\ndescription: API reference for `getServerSideProps`.

It should be a [serializable object](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Glossary/Serialization) so that any props passed, could be serialized with [`JSON.stringify`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify).\n\n```jsx\nexport async function getServerSideProps(context) {\n  return {\n    props: { message: `Next.js is awesome` }, // will be passed to the page component as props\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### `notFound`\n\nThe `notFound` boolean allows the page to return a `404` status and [404 Page](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/custom-error#404-page). With `notFound: true`, the page will return a `404` even if there was a successfully generated page before. This is meant to support use cases like user-generated content getting removed by its author.\n\n```js\nexport async function getServerSideProps(context) {\n  const res = await fetch(`https://.../data`)\n  const data = await res.json()\n\n  if (!data) {\n    return {\n      notFound: true,\n    }\n  }\n\n  return {\n    props: { data }, // will be passed to the page component as props\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### `redirect`\n\nThe `redirect` object allows redirecting to internal and external resources. It should match the shape of `{ destination: string, permanent: boolean }`. In some rare cases, you might need to assign a custom status code for older `HTTP` clients to properly redirect. In these cases, you can use the `statusCode` property instead of the `permanent` property, but not both.\n\n```js\nexport async function getServerSideProps(context) {\n  const res = await fetch(`https://.../data`)\n  const data = await res.json()\n\n  if (!data) {\n    return {\n      redirect: {\n        destination: '/',\n        permanent: false,\n      },\n    }\n  }\n\n  return {\n    props: {}, // will be passed to the page component as props\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Version History\n\n| Version   | Changes                                                                                                     |\n| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `v13.4.0` | [App Router](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching) is now stable with simplified data fetching |\n| `v10.0.0` | `locale`, `locales`, `defaultLocale`, and `notFound` options added.                                         |\n| `v9.3.0`  | `getServerSideProps` introduced.                                                                            |\n"},{"path":"docs/03-pages/02-api-reference/02-functions/userAgent.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/03-pages/02-api-reference/02-functions/userAgent.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/userAgent","sha":"21b37946d3c1342b72141cf7b5dc3e7315fd1edb","size":558,"content":"---\ntitle: userAgent\ndescription: The userAgent helper extends the Web Request API with additional properties and methods to interact with the user agent object from the request.\nsource: app/api-reference/functions/userAgent\n---\n\n{/* DO NOT EDIT.

Can be one of: \"build\" (run at build time), \"stale\" (revalidate period expired, or running in [development mode](/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-static-props#runs-on-every-request-in-development)), \"on-demand\" (triggered via [on-demand revalidation](/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/incremental-static-regeneration#on-demand-revalidation)) |\n\n## getStaticProps return values\n\nThe `getStaticProps` function should return an object containing either `props`, `redirect`, or `notFound` followed by an **optional** `revalidate` property.\n\n### `props`\n\nThe `props` object is a key-value pair, where each value is received by the page component. It should be a [serializable object](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Glossary/Serialization) so that any props passed, could be serialized with [`JSON.stringify`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify).\n\n```jsx\nexport async function getStaticProps(context) {\n  return {\n    props: { message: `Next.js is awesome` }, // will be passed to the page component as props\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### `revalidate`\n\nThe `revalidate` property is the amount in seconds after which a page re-generation can occur (defaults to `false` or no revalidation).\n\n```js\n// This function gets called at build time on server-side.\n// It may be called again, on a serverless function, if\n// revalidation is enabled and a new request comes in\nexport async function getStaticProps() {\n  const res = await fetch('https://.../posts')\n  const posts = await res.json()\n\n  return {\n    props: {\n      posts,\n    },\n    // Next.js will attempt to re-generate the page:\n    // - When a request comes in\n    // - At most once every 10 seconds\n    revalidate: 10, // In seconds\n  }\n}\n```\n\nLearn more about [Incremental Static Regeneration](/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/incremental-static-regeneration).\n\nThe cache status of a page leveraging ISR can be determined by reading the value of the `x-nextjs-cache` response header. The possible values are the following:\n\n- `MISS` - the path is not in the cache (occurs at most once, on the first visit)\n- `STALE` - the path is in the cache but exceeded the revalidate time so it will be updated in the background\n- `HIT` - the path is in the cache and has not exceeded the revalidate time\n\n### `notFound`\n\nThe `notFound` boolean allows the page to return a `404` status and [404 Page](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/custom-error#404-page). With `notFound: true`, the page will return a `404` even if there was a successfully generated page before. This is meant to support use cases like user-generated content getting removed by its author. Note, `notFound` follows the same `revalidate` behavior [described here](#revalidate).\n\n```js\nexport async function getStaticProps(context) {\n  const res = await fetch(`https://.../data`)\n  const data = await res.json()\n\n  if (!data) {\n    return {\n      notFound: true,\n    }\n  }\n\n  return {\n    props: { data }, // will be passed to the page component as props\n  }\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know**: `notFound` is not needed for [`fallback: false`](/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/get-static-paths#fallback-false) mode as only paths returned from `getStaticPaths` will be pre-rendered.\n\n### `redirect`\n\nThe `redirect` object allows redirecting to internal or external resources. It should match the shape of `{ destination: string, permanent: boolean }`.\n\nIn some rare cases, you might need to assign a custom status code for older `HTTP` clients to properly redirect. In these cases, you can use the `statusCode` property instead of the `permanent` property, **but not both**. You can also set `basePath: false` similar to redirects in `next.config.js`.\n\n```js\nexport async function getStaticProps(context) {\n  const res = await fetch(`https://...`)\n  const data = await res.json()\n\n  if (!data) {\n    return {\n      redirect: {\n        destination: '/',\n        permanent: false,\n        // statusCode: 301\n      },\n    }\n  }\n\n  return {\n    props: { data }, // will be passed to the page component as props\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIf the redirects are known at build-time, they should be added in [`next.config.js`](/docs/pages/api-reference/next-config-js/redirects) instead.\n\n## Reading files: Use `process.cwd()`\n\nFiles can be read directly from the filesystem in `getStaticProps`.\n\nIn order to do so you have to get the full path to a file.\n\nSince Next.js compiles your code into a separate directory you can't use `__dirname` as the path it returns will be different from the Pages Router.\n\nInstead you can use `process.cwd()` which gives you the directory where Next.js is being executed.\n\n```jsx\nimport { promises as fs } from 'fs'\nimport path from 'path'\n\n// posts will be populated at build time by getStaticProps()\nfunction Blog({ posts }) {\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {posts.map((post) => (\n        <li>\n          <h3>{post.filename}</h3>\n          <p>{post.content}</p>\n        </li>\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  )\n}\n\n// This function gets called at build time on server-side.\n// It won't be called on client-side, so you can even do\n// direct database queries.\nexport async function getStaticProps() {\n  const postsDirectory = path.join(process.cwd(), 'posts')\n  const filenames = await fs.readdir(postsDirectory)\n\n  const posts = filenames.map(async (filename) => {\n    const filePath = path.join(postsDirectory, filename)\n    const fileContents = await fs.readFile(filePath, 'utf8')\n\n    // Generally you would parse/transform the contents\n    // For example you can transform markdown to HTML here\n\n    return {\n      filename,\n      content: fileContents,\n    }\n  })\n  // By returning { props: { posts } }, the Blog component\n  // will receive `posts` as a prop at build time\n  return {\n    props: {\n      posts: await Promise.all(posts),\n    },\n  }\n}\n\nexport default Blog\n```\n\n## Version History\n\n| Version   | Changes                                                                                                                                                               |\n| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `v13.4.0` | [App Router](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching) is now stable with simplified data fetching                                                           |\n| `v12.2.0` | [On-Demand Incremental Static Regeneration](/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/incremental-static-regeneration#on-demand-revalidation) is stable.    |\n| `v12.1.0` | [On-Demand Incremental Static Regeneration](/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/incremental-static-regeneration#on-demand-revalidation) added (beta). |\n| `v10.0.0` | `locale`, `locales`, `defaultLocale`, and `notFound` options added.                                                                                                   |\n| `v10.0.0` | `fallback: 'blocking'` return option added.                                                                                                                           |\n| `v9.5.0`  | Stable [Incremental Static Regeneration](/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/incremental-static-regeneration)                                         |\n| `v9.3.0`  | `getStaticProps` introduced.                                                                                                                                          |\n"},{"path":"docs/03-pages/02-api-reference/02-functions/get-static-paths.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/03-pages/02-api-reference/02-functions/get-static-paths.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/get-static-paths","sha":"50c50e389f9fb9c61407c7b664e38a7a3f56304f","size":12800,"content":"---\ntitle: getStaticPaths\ndescription: API reference for `getStaticPaths`. Learn how to fetch data and generate static pages with `getStaticPaths`.\n---\n\nWhen exporting a function called `getStaticPaths` from a page that uses [Dynamic Routes](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes), Next.js will statically pre-render all the paths specified by `getStaticPaths`.\n\n```tsx filename=\"pages/repo/[name].tsx\" switcher\nimport type {\n  InferGetStaticPropsType,\n  GetStaticProps,\n  GetStaticPaths,\n} from 'next'\n\ntype Repo = {\n  name: string\n  stargazers_count: number\n}\n\nexport const getStaticPaths = (async () => {\n  return {\n    paths: [\n      {\n        params: {\n          name: 'next.js',\n        },\n      }, // See the \"paths\" section below\n    ],\n    fallback: true, // false or \"blocking\"\n  }\n}) satisfies GetStaticPaths\n\nexport const getStaticProps = (async (context) => {\n  const res = await fetch('https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js')\n  const repo = await res.json()\n  return { props: { repo } }\n}) satisfies GetStaticProps<{\n  repo: Repo\n}>\n\nexport default function Page({\n  repo,\n}: InferGetStaticPropsType<typeof getStaticProps>) {\n  return repo.stargazers_count\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"pages/repo/[name].js\" switcher\nexport async function getStaticPaths() {\n  return {\n    paths: [\n      {\n        params: {\n          name: 'next.js',\n        },\n      }, // See the \"paths\" section below\n    ],\n    fallback: true, // false or \"blocking\"\n  }\n}\n\nexport async function getStaticProps() {\n  const res = await fetch('https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js')\n  const repo = await res.json()\n  return { props: { repo } }\n}\n\nexport default function Page({ repo }) {\n  return repo.stargazers_count\n}\n```\n\n## getStaticPaths return values\n\nThe `getStaticPaths` function should return an object with the following **required** properties:\n\n### `paths`\n\nThe `paths` key determines which paths will be pre-rendered. For example, suppose that you have a page that uses [Dynamic Routes](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes) named `pages/posts/[id].js`. If you export `getStaticPaths` from this page and return the following for `paths`:\n\n```js\nreturn {\n  paths: [\n    { params: { id: '1' }},\n    {\n      params: { id: '2' },\n      // with i18n configured the locale for the path can be returned as well\n      locale: \"en\",\n    },\n  ],\n  fallback: ...\n}\n```\n\nThen, Next.js will statically generate `/posts/1` and `/posts/2` during `next build` using the page component in `pages/posts/[id].js`.\n\nThe value for each `params` object must match the parameters used in the page name:\n\n- If the page name is `pages/posts/[postId]/[commentId]`, then `params` should contain `postId` and `commentId`.\n- If the page name uses [catch-all routes](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes#catch-all-segments) like `pages/[...slug]`, then `params` should contain `slug` (which is an array). If this array is `['hello', 'world']`, then Next.js will statically generate the page at `/hello/world`.\n- If the page uses an [optional catch-all route](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes#optional-catch-all-segments), use `null`, `[]`, `undefined` or `false` to render the root-most route. For example, if you supply `slug: false` for `pages/[[...slug]]`, Next.js will statically generate the page `/`.\n\nThe `params` strings are **case-sensitive** and ideally should be normalized to ensure the paths are generated correctly. For example, if `WoRLD` is returned for a param it will only match if `WoRLD` is the actual path visited, not `world` or `World`.\n\nSeparate of the `params` object a `locale` field can be returned when [i18n is configured](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/internationalization), which configures the locale for the path being generated.\n\n### `fallback: false`\n\nIf `fallback` is `false`, then any paths not returned by `getStaticPaths` will result in a **404 page**.\n\nWhen `next build` is run, Next.js will check if `getStaticPaths` returned `fallback: false`, it will then build **only** the paths returned by `getStaticPaths`. This option is useful if you have a small number of paths to create, or new page data is not added often. If you find that you need to add more paths, and you have `fallback: false`, you will need to run `next build` again so that the new paths can be generated.\n\nThe following example pre-renders one blog post per page called `pages/posts/[id].js`. The list of blog posts will be fetched from a CMS and returned by `getStaticPaths`. Then, for each page, it fetches the post data from a CMS using [`getStaticProps`](/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-static-props).\n\n```jsx filename=\"pages/posts/[id].js\"\nfunction Post({ post }) {\n  // Render post...\n}\n\n// This function gets called at build time\nexport async function getStaticPaths() {\n  // Call an external API endpoint to get posts\n  const res = await fetch('https://.../posts')\n  const posts = await res.json()\n\n  // Get the paths we want to pre-render based on posts\n  const paths = posts.map((post) => ({\n    params: { id: post.id },\n  }))\n\n  // We'll pre-render only these paths at build time.\n  // { fallback: false } means other routes should 404.\n  return { paths, fallback: false }\n}\n\n// This also gets called at build time\nexport async function getStaticProps({ params }) {\n  // params contains the post `id`.\n  // If the route is like /posts/1, then params.id is 1\n  const res = await fetch(`https://.../posts/${params.id}`)\n  const post = await res.json()\n\n  // Pass post data to the page via props\n  return { props: { post } }\n}\n\nexport default Post\n```\n\n### `fallback: true`\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Examples</summary>\n\n- [Static generation of a large number of pages](https://static-tweet.vercel.app)\n\n</details>\n\nIf `fallback` is `true`, then the behavior of `getStaticProps` changes in the following ways:\n\n- The paths returned from `getStaticPaths` will be rendered to `HTML` at build time by `getStaticProps`.\n- The paths that have not been generated at build time will **not** result in a 404 page. Instead, Next.js will serve a [“fallback”](#fallback-pages) version of the page on the first request to such a path. Web crawlers, such as Google, won't be served a fallback and instead the path will behave as in [`fallback: 'blocking'`](#fallback-blocking).\n- When a page with `fallback: true` is navigated to through `next/link` or `next/router` (client-side) Next.js will _not_ serve a fallback and instead the page will behave as [`fallback: 'blocking'`](#fallback-blocking).\n- In the background, Next.js will statically generate the requested path `HTML` and `JSON`. This includes running `getStaticProps`.\n- When complete, the browser receives the `JSON` for the generated path. This will be used to automatically render the page with the required props. From the user’s perspective, the page will be swapped from the fallback page to the full page.\n- At the same time, Next.js adds this path to the list of pre-rendered pages. Subsequent requests to the same path will serve the generated page, like other pages pre-rendered at build time.\n\n> **Good to know**: `fallback: true` is not supported when using [`output: 'export'`](/docs/pages/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports).\n\n#### When is `fallback: true` useful?\n\n`fallback: true` is useful if your app has a very large number of static pages that depend on data (such as a very large e-commerce site). If you want to pre-render all product pages, the builds would take a very long time.\n\nInstead, you may statically generate a small subset of pages and use `fallback: true` for the rest. When someone requests a page that is not generated yet, the user will see the page with a loading indicator or skeleton component.\n\nShortly after, `getStaticProps` finishes and the page will be rendered with the requested data. From now on, everyone who requests the same page will get the statically pre-rendered page.\n\nThis ensures that users always have a fast experience while preserving fast builds and the benefits of Static Generation.\n\n`fallback: true` will not _update_ generated pages, for that take a look at [Incremental Static Regeneration](/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/incremental-static-regeneration).\n\n### `fallback: 'blocking'`\n\nIf `fallback` is `'blocking'`, new paths not returned by `getStaticPaths` will wait for the `HTML` to be generated, identical to SSR (hence why _blocking_), and then be cached for future requests so it only happens once per path.\n\n`getStaticProps` will behave as follows:\n\n- The paths returned from `getStaticPaths` will be rendered to `HTML` at build time by `getStaticProps`.\n- The paths that have not been generated at build time will **not** result in a 404 page. Instead, Next.js will SSR on the first request and return the generated `HTML`.\n- When complete, the browser receives the `HTML` for the generated path. From the user’s perspective, it will transition from \"the browser is requesting the page\" to \"the full page is loaded\". There is no flash of loading/fallback state.\n- At the same time, Next.js adds this path to the list of pre-rendered pages. Subsequent requests to the same path will serve the generated page, like other pages pre-rendered at build time.\n\n`fallback: 'blocking'` will not _update_ generated pages by default. To update generated pages, use [Incremental Static Regeneration](/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/incremental-static-regeneration) in conjunction with `fallback: 'blocking'`.\n\n> **Good to know**: `fallback: 'blocking'` is not supported when using [`output: 'export'`](/docs/pages/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports).\n\n### Fallback pages\n\nIn the “fallback” version of a page:\n\n- The page’s props will be empty.\n- Using the [router](/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/use-router), you can detect if the fallback is being rendered, `router.isFallback` will be `true`.\n\nThe following example showcases using `isFallback`:\n\n```jsx filename=\"pages/posts/[id].js\"\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/router'\n\nfunction Post({ post }) {\n  const router = useRouter()\n\n  // If the page is not yet generated, this will be displayed\n  // initially until getStaticProps() finishes running\n  if (router.isFallback) {\n    return <div>Loading...</div>\n  }\n\n  // Render post...\n}\n\n// This function gets called at build time\nexport async function getStaticPaths() {\n  return {\n    // Only `/posts/1` and `/posts/2` are generated at build time\n    paths: [{ params: { id: '1' } }, { params: { id: '2' } }],\n    // Enable statically generating additional pages\n    // For example: `/posts/3`\n    fallback: true,\n  }\n}\n\n// This also gets called at build time\nexport async function getStaticProps({ params }) {\n  // params contains the post `id`.\n  // If the route is like /posts/1, then params.id is 1\n  const res = await fetch(`https://.../posts/${params.id}`)\n  const post = await res.json()\n\n  // Pass post data to the page via props\n  return {\n    props: { post },\n    // Re-generate the post at most once per second\n    // if a request comes in\n    revalidate: 1,\n  }\n}\n\nexport default Post\n```\n\n## Version History\n\n| Version   | Changes                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `v13.4.0` | [App Router](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching) is now stable with simplified data fetching, including [`generateStaticParams()`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-static-params) |\n| `v12.2.0` | [On-Demand Incremental Static Regeneration](/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/incremental-static-regeneration#on-demand-revalidation) is stable.                                          |\n| `v12.1.0` | [On-Demand Incremental Static Regeneration](/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/incremental-static-regeneration#on-demand-revalidation) added (beta).                                       |\n| `v9.5.0`  | Stable [Incremental Static Regeneration](/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/incremental-static-regeneration)                                                                               |\n| `v9.3.0`  | `getStaticPaths` introduced.                                                                                                                                                                                |\n"},{"path":"docs/03-pages/02-api-reference/02-functions/next-request.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/03-pages/02-api-reference/02-functions/next-request.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/next-request","sha":"fa85f33e18078bf37f0af2e81b507e6df5cf4071","size":449,"content":"---\ntitle: NextRequest\ndescription: API Reference for NextRequest.\nsource: app/api-reference/functions/next-request\n---\n\n{/* DO NOT EDIT.

'red' : 'black',\n  }\n\n  const handleClick = (e) => {\n    e.preventDefault()\n    router.push(href)\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <a href={href} onClick={handleClick} style={style}>\n      {children}\n    </a>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default ActiveLink\n```\n\n> `useRouter` is a [React Hook](https://react.dev/learn#using-hooks), meaning it cannot be used with classes. You can either use [withRouter](#withrouter) or wrap your class in a function component.\n\n## `router` object\n\nThe following is the definition of the `router` object returned by both [`useRouter`](#top) and [`withRouter`](#withrouter):\n\n- `pathname`: `String` - The path for current route file that comes after `/pages`. Therefore, `basePath`, `locale` and trailing slash (`trailingSlash: true`) are not included.\n- `query`: `Object` - The query string parsed to an object, including [dynamic route](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes) parameters. It will be an empty object during prerendering if the page doesn't use [Server-side Rendering](/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-server-side-props). Defaults to `{}`\n- `asPath`: `String` - The path as shown in the browser including the search params and respecting the `trailingSlash` configuration. `basePath` and `locale` are not included.\n- `isFallback`: `boolean` - Whether the current page is in [fallback mode](/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/get-static-paths#fallback-true).\n- `basePath`: `String` - The active [basePath](/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/basePath) (if enabled).\n- `locale`: `String` - The active locale (if enabled).\n- `locales`: `String[]` - All supported locales (if enabled).\n- `defaultLocale`: `String` - The current default locale (if enabled).\n- `domainLocales`: `Array<{domain, defaultLocale, locales}>` - Any configured domain locales.\n- `isReady`: `boolean` - Whether the router fields are updated client-side and ready for use. Should only be used inside of `useEffect` methods and not for conditionally rendering on the server. See related docs for use case with [automatically statically optimized pages](/docs/pages/building-your-application/rendering/automatic-static-optimization)\n- `isPreview`: `boolean` - Whether the application is currently in [preview mode](/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/preview-mode).\n\n> Using the `asPath` field may lead to a mismatch between client and server if the page is rendered using server-side rendering or [automatic static optimization](/docs/pages/building-your-application/rendering/automatic-static-optimization). Avoid using `asPath` until the `isReady` field is `true`.\n\nThe following methods are included inside `router`:\n\n### router.push\n\nHandles client-side transitions, this method is useful for cases where [`next/link`](/docs/pages/api-reference/components/link) is not enough.\n\n```js\nrouter.push(url, as, options)\n```\n\n- `url`: `UrlObject | String` - The URL to navigate to (see [Node.JS URL module documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/url.html#legacy-urlobject) for `UrlObject` properties).\n- `as`: `UrlObject | String` - Optional decorator for the path that will be shown in the browser URL bar. Before Next.js 9.5.3 this was used for dynamic routes.\n- `options` - Optional object with the following configuration options:\n  - `scroll` - Optional boolean, controls scrolling to the top of the page after navigation. Defaults to `true`\n  - [`shallow`](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/linking-and-navigating#shallow-routing): Update the path of the current page without rerunning [`getStaticProps`](/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-static-props), [`getServerSideProps`](/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-server-side-props) or [`getInitialProps`](/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/get-initial-props). Defaults to `false`\n  - `locale` - Optional string, indicates locale of the new page\n\n> You don't need to use `router.push` for external URLs. [window.location](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Window/location) is better suited for those cases.\n\nNavigating to `pages/about.js`, which is a predefined route:\n\n```jsx\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/router'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  const router = useRouter()\n\n  return (\n    <button type=\"button\" onClick={() => router.push('/about')}>\n      Click me\n    </button>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nNavigating `pages/post/[pid].js`, which is a dynamic route:\n\n```jsx\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/router'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  const router = useRouter()\n\n  return (\n    <button type=\"button\" onClick={() => router.push('/post/abc')}>\n      Click me\n    </button>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nRedirecting the user to `pages/login.js`, useful for pages behind [authentication](/docs/pages/building-your-application/authentication):\n\n```jsx\nimport { useEffect } from 'react'\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/router'\n\n// Here you would fetch and return the user\nconst useUser = () => ({ user: null, loading: false })\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  const { user, loading } = useUser()\n  const router = useRouter()\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    if (!(user || loading)) {\n      router.push('/login')\n    }\n  }, [user, loading])\n\n  return <p>Redirecting...</p>\n}\n```\n\n#### Resetting state after navigation\n\nWhen navigating to the same page in Next.js, the page's state **will not** be reset by default as React does not unmount unless the parent component has changed.\n\n```jsx filename=\"pages/[slug].js\"\nimport Link from 'next/link'\nimport { useState } from 'react'\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/router'\n\nexport default function Page(props) {\n  const router = useRouter()\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Page: {router.query.slug}</h1>\n      <p>Count: {count}</p>\n      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increase count</button>\n      <Link href=\"/one\">one</Link> <Link href=\"/two\">two</Link>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nIn the above example, navigating between `/one` and `/two` **will not** reset the count . The `useState` is maintained between renders because the top-level React component, `Page`, is the same.\n\nIf you do not want this behavior, you have a couple of options:\n\n- Manually ensure each state is updated using `useEffect`. In the above example, that could look like:\n\n  ```jsx\n  useEffect(() => {\n    setCount(0)\n  }, [router.query.slug])\n  ```\n\n- Use a React `key` to [tell React to remount the component](https://react.dev/learn/rendering-lists#keeping-list-items-in-order-with-key). To do this for all pages, you can use a custom app:\n\n  ```jsx filename=\"pages/_app.js\"\n  import { useRouter } from 'next/router'\n\n  export default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {\n    const router = useRouter()\n    return <Component key={router.asPath} {...pageProps} />\n  }\n  ```\n\n#### With URL object\n\nYou can use a URL object in the same way you can use it for [`next/link`](/docs/pages/api-reference/components/link#with-url-object). Works for both the `url` and `as` parameters:\n\n```jsx\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/router'\n\nexport default function ReadMore({ post }) {\n  const router = useRouter()\n\n  return (\n    <button\n      type=\"button\"\n      onClick={() => {\n        router.push({\n          pathname: '/post/[pid]',\n          query: { pid: post.id },\n        })\n      }}\n    >\n      Click here to read more\n    </button>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### router.replace\n\nSimilar to the `replace` prop in [`next/link`](/docs/pages/api-reference/components/link), `router.replace` will prevent adding a new URL entry into the `history` stack.\n\n```js\nrouter.replace(url, as, options)\n```\n\n- The API for `router.replace` is exactly the same as the API for [`router.push`](#routerpush).\n\nTake a look at the following example:\n\n```jsx\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/router'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  const router = useRouter()\n\n  return (\n    <button type=\"button\" onClick={() => router.replace('/home')}>\n      Click me\n    </button>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### router.prefetch\n\nPrefetch pages for faster client-side transitions. This method is only useful for navigations without [`next/link`](/docs/pages/api-reference/components/link), as `next/link` takes care of prefetching pages automatically.\n\n> This is a production only feature. Next.js doesn't prefetch pages in development.\n\n```js\nrouter.prefetch(url, as, options)\n```\n\n- `url` - The URL to prefetch, including explicit routes (e.g. `/dashboard`) and dynamic routes (e.g. `/product/[id]`)\n- `as` - Optional decorator for `url`. Before Next.js 9.5.3 this was used to prefetch dynamic routes.\n- `options` - Optional object with the following allowed fields:\n  - `locale` - allows providing a different locale from the active one. If `false`, `url` has to include the locale as the active locale won't be used.\n\nLet's say you have a login page, and after a login, you redirect the user to the dashboard. For that case, we can prefetch the dashboard to make a faster transition, like in the following example:\n\n```jsx\nimport { useCallback, useEffect } from 'react'\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/router'\n\nexport default function Login() {\n  const router = useRouter()\n  const handleSubmit = useCallback((e) => {\n    e.preventDefault()\n\n    fetch('/api/login', {\n      method: 'POST',\n      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },\n      body: JSON.stringify({\n        /* Form data */\n      }),\n    }).then((res) => {\n      // Do a fast client-side transition to the already prefetched dashboard page\n      if (res.ok) router.push('/dashboard')\n    })\n  }, [])\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    // Prefetch the dashboard page\n    router.prefetch('/dashboard')\n  }, [router])\n\n  return (\n    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>\n      {/* Form fields */}\n      <button type=\"submit\">Login</button>\n    </form>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### router.beforePopState\n\nIn some cases (for example, if using a [Custom Server](/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/custom-server)), you may wish to listen to [popstate](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Events/popstate) and do something before the router acts on it.\n\n```js\nrouter.beforePopState(cb)\n```\n\n- `cb` - The function to run on incoming `popstate` events. The function receives the state of the event as an object with the following props:\n  - `url`: `String` - the route for the new state. This is usually the name of a `page`\n  - `as`: `String` - the url that will be shown in the browser\n  - `options`: `Object` - Additional options sent by [router.push](#routerpush)\n\nIf `cb` returns `false`, the Next.js router will not handle `popstate`, and you'll be responsible for handling it in that case. See [Disabling file-system routing](/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/custom-server#disabling-file-system-routing).\n\nYou could use `beforePopState` to manipulate the request, or force a SSR refresh, as in the following example:\n\n```jsx\nimport { useEffect } from 'react'\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/router'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  const router = useRouter()\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    router.beforePopState(({ url, as, options }) => {\n      // I only want to allow these two routes!\n      if (as !== '/' && as !== '/other') {\n        // Have SSR render bad routes as a 404.\n        window.location.href = as\n        return false\n      }\n\n      return true\n    })\n  }, [router])\n\n  return <p>Welcome to the page</p>\n}\n```\n\n### router.back\n\nNavigate back in history. Equivalent to clicking the browser’s back button. It executes `window.history.back()`.\n\n```jsx\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/router'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  const router = useRouter()\n\n  return (\n    <button type=\"button\" onClick={() => router.back()}>\n      Click here to go back\n    </button>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### router.reload\n\nReload the current URL. Equivalent to clicking the browser’s refresh button. It executes `window.location.reload()`.\n\n```jsx\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/router'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  const router = useRouter()\n\n  return (\n    <button type=\"button\" onClick={() => router.reload()}>\n      Click here to reload\n    </button>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### router.events\n\nYou can listen to different events happening inside the Next.js Router. Here's a list of supported events:\n\n- `routeChangeStart(url, { shallow })` - Fires when a route starts to change\n- `routeChangeComplete(url, { shallow })` - Fires when a route changed completely\n- `routeChangeError(err, url, { shallow })` - Fires when there's an error when changing routes, or a route load is cancelled\n  - `err.cancelled` - Indicates if the navigation was cancelled\n- `beforeHistoryChange(url, { shallow })` - Fires before changing the browser's history\n- `hashChangeStart(url, { shallow })` - Fires when the hash will change but not the page\n- `hashChangeComplete(url, { shallow })` - Fires when the hash has changed but not the page\n\n> **Good to know**: Here `url` is the URL shown in the browser, including the [`basePath`](/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/basePath).\n\nFor example, to listen to the router event `routeChangeStart`, open or create `pages/_app.js` and subscribe to the event, like so:\n\n```jsx\nimport { useEffect } from 'react'\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/router'\n\nexport default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {\n  const router = useRouter()\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const handleRouteChange = (url, { shallow }) => {\n      console.log(\n        `App is changing to ${url} ${\n          shallow ? 'with' : 'without'\n        } shallow routing`\n      )\n    }\n\n    router.events.on('routeChangeStart', handleRouteChange)\n\n    // If the component is unmounted, unsubscribe\n    // from the event with the `off` method:\n    return () => {\n      router.events.off('routeChangeStart', handleRouteChange)\n    }\n  }, [router])\n\n  return <Component {...pageProps} />\n}\n```\n\n> We use a [Custom App](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/custom-app) (`pages/_app.js`) for this example to subscribe to the event because it's not unmounted on page navigations, but you can subscribe to router events on any component in your application.\n\nRouter events should be registered when a component mounts ([useEffect](https://react.dev/reference/react/useEffect) or [componentDidMount](https://react.dev/reference/react/Component#componentdidmount) / [componentWillUnmount](https://react.dev/reference/react/Component#componentwillunmount)) or imperatively when an event happens.\n\nIf a route load is cancelled (for example, by clicking two links rapidly in succession), `routeChangeError` will fire. And the passed `err` will contain a `cancelled` property set to `true`, as in the following example:\n\n```jsx\nimport { useEffect } from 'react'\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/router'\n\nexport default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {\n  const router = useRouter()\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const handleRouteChangeError = (err, url) => {\n      if (err.cancelled) {\n        console.log(`Route to ${url} was cancelled!`)\n      }\n    }\n\n    router.events.on('routeChangeError', handleRouteChangeError)\n\n    // If the component is unmounted, unsubscribe\n    // from the event with the `off` method:\n    return () => {\n      router.events.off('routeChangeError', handleRouteChangeError)\n    }\n  }, [router])\n\n  return <Component {...pageProps} />\n}\n```\n\n## Potential ESLint errors\n\nCertain methods accessible on the `router` object return a Promise. If you have the ESLint rule, [no-floating-promises](https://typescript-eslint.io/rules/no-floating-promises) enabled, consider disabling it either globally, or for the affected line.\n\nIf your application needs this rule, you should either `void` the promise – or use an `async` function, `await` the Promise, then void the function call. **This is not applicable when the method is called from inside an `onClick` handler**.\n\nThe affected methods are:\n\n- `router.push`\n- `router.replace`\n- `router.prefetch`\n\n### Potential solutions\n\n```jsx\nimport { useEffect } from 'react'\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/router'\n\n// Here you would fetch and return the user\nconst useUser = () => ({ user: null, loading: false })\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  const { user, loading } = useUser()\n  const router = useRouter()\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    // disable the linting on the next line - This is the cleanest solution\n    // eslint-disable-next-line no-floating-promises\n    router.push('/login')\n\n    // void the Promise returned by router.push\n    if (!(user || loading)) {\n      void router.push('/login')\n    }\n    // or use an async function, await the Promise, then void the function call\n    async function handleRouteChange() {\n      if (!(user || loading)) {\n        await router.push('/login')\n      }\n    }\n    void handleRouteChange()\n  }, [user, loading])\n\n  return <p>Redirecting...</p>\n}\n```\n\n## withRouter\n\nIf [`useRouter`](#router-object) is not the best fit for you, `withRouter` can also add the same [`router` object](#router-object) to any component.\n\n### Usage\n\n```jsx\nimport { withRouter } from 'next/router'\n\nfunction Page({ router }) {\n  return <p>{router.pathname}</p>\n}\n\nexport default withRouter(Page)\n```\n\n### TypeScript\n\nTo use class components with `withRouter`, the component needs to accept a router prop:\n\n```tsx\nimport React from 'react'\nimport { withRouter, NextRouter } from 'next/router'\n\ninterface WithRouterProps {\n  router: NextRouter\n}\n\ninterface MyComponentProps extends WithRouterProps {}\n\nclass MyComponent extends React.Component<MyComponentProps> {\n  render() {\n    return <p>{this.props.router.pathname}</p>\n  }\n}\n\nexport default withRouter(MyComponent)\n```\n"},{"path":"docs/03-pages/02-api-reference/02-functions/use-amp.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/03-pages/02-api-reference/02-functions/use-amp.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/use-amp","sha":"9b94eb38a86858ada0345b035902d732578aecfb","size":2493,"content":"---\ntitle: useAmp\ndescription: Enable AMP in a page, and control the way Next.js adds AMP to the page with the AMP config.\n---\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Examples</summary>\n\n- [AMP](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/amp)\n\n</details>\n\n> AMP support is one of our advanced features, you can [read more about AMP here](/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/amp).\n\nTo enable AMP, add the following config to your page:\n\n```jsx filename=\"pages/index.js\"\nexport const config = { amp: true }\n```\n\nThe `amp` config accepts the following values:\n\n- `true` - The page will be AMP-only\n- `'hybrid'` - The page will have two versions, one with AMP and another one with HTML\n\nTo learn more about the `amp` config, read the sections below.\n\n## AMP First Page\n\nTake a look at the following example:\n\n```jsx filename=\"pages/about.js\"\nexport const config = { amp: true }\n\nfunction About(props) {\n  return <h3>My AMP About Page!</h3>\n}\n\nexport default About\n```\n\nThe page above is an AMP-only page, which means:\n\n- The page has no Next.js or React client-side runtime\n- The page is automatically optimized with [AMP Optimizer](https://github.com/ampproject/amp-toolbox/tree/master/packages/optimizer), an optimizer that applies the same transformations as AMP caches (improves performance by up to 42%)\n- The page has a user-accessible (optimized) version of the page and a search-engine indexable (unoptimized) version of the page\n\n## Hybrid AMP Page\n\nTake a look at the following example:\n\n```jsx filename=\"pages/about.js\"\nimport { useAmp } from 'next/amp'\n\nexport const config = { amp: 'hybrid' }\n\nfunction About(props) {\n  const isAmp = useAmp()\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h3>My AMP About Page!</h3>\n      {isAmp ?

However, you can access [`headers`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/headers) and [`cookies`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/cookies) through server-only functions. You can also [set cookies](#how-can-i-set-cookies).\n\n[Layouts](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/layouts-and-templates#layouts) do not rerender. They can be cached and reused to avoid unnecessary computation when navigating between pages. By restricting layouts from accessing the raw request, Next.js can prevent the execution of potentially slow or expensive user code within the layout, which could negatively impact performance.\n\nThis design also enforces consistent and predictable behavior for layouts across different pages, which simplifies development and debugging.\n\nDepending on the UI pattern you're building, [Parallel Routes](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/parallel-routes) allow you to render multiple pages in the same layout, and pages have access to the route segments as well as the URL search params.\n\n### How can I access the URL on a page?\n\nBy default, pages are Server Components. You can access the route segments through the [`params`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/page#params-optional) prop and the URL search params through the [`searchParams`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/page#searchparams-optional) prop for a given page.\n\nIf you are using Client Components, you can use [`usePathname`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-pathname), [`useSelectedLayoutSegment`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-selected-layout-segment), and [`useSelectedLayoutSegments`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-selected-layout-segments) for more complex routes.\n\nFurther, depending on the UI pattern you're building, [Parallel Routes](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/parallel-routes) allow you to render multiple pages in the same layout, and pages have access to the route segments as well as the URL search params.\n\n### How can I redirect from a Server Component?\n\nYou can use [`redirect`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/redirect) to redirect from a page to a relative or absolute URL. [`redirect`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/redirect) is a temporary (307) redirect, while [`permanentRedirect`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/permanentRedirect) is a permanent (308) redirect. When these functions are used while streaming UI, they will insert a meta tag to emit the redirect on the client side.\n\n### How can I handle authentication with the App Router?\n\nHere are some common authentication solutions that support the App Router:\n\n- [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/nextjs#in-app-router)\n- [Clerk](https://clerk.com/docs/quickstarts/nextjs)\n- [Lucia](https://lucia-auth.com/getting-started/nextjs-app)\n- [Auth0](https://github.com/auth0/nextjs-auth0#app-router)\n- [Stytch](https://stytch.com/docs/example-apps/frontend/nextjs)\n- [Kinde](https://kinde.com/docs/developer-tools/nextjs-sdk/)\n- [WorkOS](https://workos.com/docs/user-management)\n- Or manually handling sessions or JWTs\n\n### How can I set cookies?\n\nYou can set cookies in [Server Actions](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions-and-mutations#cookies) or [Route Handlers](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-handlers) using the [`cookies`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/cookies) function.\n\nSince HTTP does not allow setting cookies after streaming starts, you cannot set cookies from a page or layout directly.

This page provides an in-depth look at Next.js caching mechanisms, the APIs you can use to configure them, and how they interact with each other.\n\n> **Good to know**: This page helps you understand how Next.js works under the hood but is **not** essential knowledge to be productive with Next.js. Most of Next.js' caching heuristics are determined by your API usage and have defaults for the best performance with zero or minimal configuration.\n\n## Overview\n\nHere's a high-level overview of the different caching mechanisms and their purpose:\n\n| Mechanism                                   | What                       | Where  | Purpose                                         | Duration                        |\n| ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |\n| [Request Memoization](#request-memoization) | Return values of functions | Server | Re-use data in a React Component tree           | Per-request lifecycle           |\n| [Data Cache](#data-cache)                   | Data                       | Server | Store data across user requests and deployments | Persistent (can be revalidated) |\n| [Full Route Cache](#full-route-cache)       | HTML and RSC payload       | Server | Reduce rendering cost and improve performance   | Persistent (can be revalidated) |\n| [Router Cache](#client-side-router-cache)   | RSC Payload                | Client | Reduce server requests on navigation            | User session or time-based      |\n\nBy default, Next.js will cache as much as possible to improve performance and reduce cost. This means routes are **statically rendered** and data requests are **cached** unless you opt out. The diagram below shows the default caching behavior: when a route is statically rendered at build time and when a static route is first visited.\n\n<Image\n  alt=\"Diagram showing the default caching behavior in Next.js for the four mechanisms, with HIT, MISS and SET at build time and when a route is first visited.\"\n  srcLight=\"/docs/light/caching-overview.png\"\n  srcDark=\"/docs/dark/caching-overview.png\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"1179\"\n/>\n\nCaching behavior changes depending on whether the route is statically or dynamically rendered, data is cached or uncached, and whether a request is part of an initial visit or a subsequent navigation. Depending on your use case, you can configure the caching behavior for individual routes and data requests.\n\n## Request Memoization\n\nNext.js extends the [`fetch` API](#fetch) to automatically **memoize** requests that have the same URL and options. This means you can call a fetch function for the same data in multiple places in a React component tree while only executing it once.\n\n<Image\n  alt=\"Deduplicated Fetch Requests\"\n  srcLight=\"/docs/light/deduplicated-fetch-requests.png\"\n  srcDark=\"/docs/dark/deduplicated-fetch-requests.png\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"857\"\n/>\n\nFor example, if you need to use the same data across a route (e.g. in a Layout, Page, and multiple components), you do not have to fetch data at the top of the tree, and forward props between components. Instead, you can fetch data in the components that need it without worrying about the performance implications of making multiple requests across the network for the same data.\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/example.tsx\" switcher\nasync function getItem() {\n  // The `fetch` function is automatically memoized and the result\n  // is cached\n  const res = await fetch('https://.../item/1')\n  return res.json()\n}\n\n// This function is called twice, but only executed the first time\nconst item = await getItem() // cache MISS\n\n// The second call could be anywhere in your route\nconst item = await getItem() // cache HIT\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/example.js\" switcher\nasync function getItem() {\n  // The `fetch` function is automatically memoized and the result\n  // is cached\n  const res = await fetch('https://.../item/1')\n  return res.json()\n}\n\n// This function is called twice, but only executed the first time\nconst item = await getItem() // cache MISS\n\n// The second call could be anywhere in your route\nconst item = await getItem() // cache HIT\n```\n\n**How Request Memoization Works**\n\n<Image\n  alt=\"Diagram showing how fetch memoization works during React rendering.\"\n  srcLight=\"/docs/light/request-memoization.png\"\n  srcDark=\"/docs/dark/request-memoization.png\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"742\"\n/>\n\n- While rendering a route, the first time a particular request is called, its result will not be in memory and it'll be a cache `MISS`.\n- Therefore, the function will be executed, and the data will be fetched from the external source, and the result will be stored in memory.\n- Subsequent function calls of the request in the same render pass will be a cache `HIT`, and the data will be returned from memory without executing the function.\n- Once the route has been rendered and the rendering pass is complete, memory is \"reset\" and all request memoization entries are cleared.\n\n> **Good to know**:\n>\n> - Request memoization is a React feature, not a Next.js feature. It's included here to show how it interacts with the other caching mechanisms.\n> - Memoization only applies to the `GET` method in `fetch` requests.\n> - Memoization only applies to the React Component tree, this means:\n>   - It applies to `fetch` requests in `generateMetadata`, `generateStaticParams`, Layouts, Pages, and other Server Components.\n>   - It doesn't apply to `fetch` requests in Route Handlers as they are not a part of the React component tree.\n> - For cases where `fetch` is not suitable (e.g. some database clients, CMS clients, or GraphQL clients), you can use the [React `cache` function](#react-cache-function) to memoize functions.\n\n### Duration\n\nThe cache lasts the lifetime of a server request until the React component tree has finished rendering.\n\n### Revalidating\n\nSince the memoization is not shared across server requests and only applies during rendering, there is no need to revalidate it.\n\n### Opting out\n\nMemoization only applies to the `GET` method in `fetch` requests, other methods, such as `POST` and `DELETE`, are not memoized. This default behavior is a React optimization and we do not recommend opting out of it.\n\nTo manage individual requests, you can use the [`signal`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortController/signal) property from [`AbortController`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortController). However, this will not opt requests out of memoization, rather, abort in-flight requests.\n\n```js filename=\"app/example.js\"\nconst { signal } = new AbortController()\nfetch(url, { signal })\n```\n\n## Data Cache\n\nNext.js has a built-in Data Cache that **persists** the result of data fetches across incoming **server requests** and **deployments**. This is possible because Next.js extends the native `fetch` API to allow each request on the server to set its own persistent caching semantics.\n\n> **Good to know**: In the browser, the `cache` option of `fetch` indicates how a request will interact with the browser's HTTP cache, in Next.js, the `cache` option indicates how a server-side request will interact with the server's Data Cache.\n\nBy default, data requests that use `fetch` are **cached**. You can use the [`cache`](#fetch-optionscache) and [`next.revalidate`](#fetch-optionsnextrevalidate) options of `fetch` to configure the caching behavior.\n\n**How the Data Cache Works**\n\n<Image\n  alt=\"Diagram showing how cached and uncached fetch requests interact with the Data Cache. Cached requests are stored in the Data Cache, and memoized, uncached requests are fetched from the data source, not stored in the Data Cache, and memoized.\"\n  srcLight=\"/docs/light/data-cache.png\"\n  srcDark=\"/docs/dark/data-cache.png\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"661\"\n/>\n\n- The first time a `fetch` request is called during rendering, Next.js checks the Data Cache for a cached response.\n- If a cached response is found, it's returned immediately and [memoized](#request-memoization).\n- If a cached response is not found, the request is made to the data source, the result is stored in the Data Cache, and memoized.\n- For uncached data (e.g. `{ cache: 'no-store' }`), the result is always fetched from the data source, and memoized.\n- Whether the data is cached or uncached, the requests are always memoized to avoid making duplicate requests for the same data during a React render pass.\n\n> **Differences between the Data Cache and Request Memoization**\n>\n> While both caching mechanisms help improve performance by re-using cached data, the Data Cache is persistent across incoming requests and deployments, whereas memoization only lasts the lifetime of a request.\n>\n> With memoization, we reduce the number of **duplicate** requests in the same render pass that have to cross the network boundary from the rendering server to the Data Cache server (e.g. a CDN or Edge Network) or data source (e.g. a database or CMS). With the Data Cache, we reduce the number of requests made to our origin data source.\n\n### Duration\n\nThe Data Cache is persistent across incoming requests and deployments unless you revalidate or opt-out.\n\n### Revalidating\n\nCached data can be revalidated in two ways, with:\n\n- **Time-based Revalidation**: Revalidate data after a certain amount of time has passed and a new request is made. This is useful for data that changes infrequently and freshness is not as critical.\n- **On-demand Revalidation:** Revalidate data based on an event (e.g. form submission). On-demand revalidation can use a tag-based or path-based approach to revalidate groups of data at once. This is useful when you want to ensure the latest data is shown as soon as possible (e.g. when content from your headless CMS is updated).\n\n#### Time-based Revalidation\n\nTo revalidate data at a timed interval, you can use the `next.revalidate` option of `fetch` to set the cache lifetime of a resource (in seconds).\n\n```js\n// Revalidate at most every hour\nfetch('https://...', { next: { revalidate: 3600 } })\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use [Route Segment Config options](#segment-config-options) to configure all `fetch` requests in a segment or for cases where you're not able to use `fetch`.\n\n**How Time-based Revalidation Works**\n\n<Image\n  alt=\"Diagram showing how time-based revalidation works, after the revalidation period, stale data is returned for the first request, then data is revalidated.\"\n  srcLight=\"/docs/light/time-based-revalidation.png\"\n  srcDark=\"/docs/dark/time-based-revalidation.png\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"1252\"\n/>\n\n- The first time a fetch request with `revalidate` is called, the data will be fetched from the external data source and stored in the Data Cache.\n- Any requests that are called within the specified timeframe (e.g. 60-seconds) will return the cached data.\n- After the timeframe, the next request will still return the cached (now stale) data.\n  - Next.js will trigger a revalidation of the data in the background.\n  - Once the data is fetched successfully, Next.js will update the Data Cache with the fresh data.\n  - If the background revalidation fails, the previous data will be kept unaltered.\n\nThis is similar to [**stale-while-revalidate**](https://web.dev/stale-while-revalidate/) behavior.\n\n#### On-demand Revalidation\n\nData can be revalidated on-demand by path ([`revalidatePath`](#revalidatepath)) or by cache tag ([`revalidateTag`](#fetch-optionsnexttags-and-revalidatetag)).\n\n**How On-Demand Revalidation Works**\n\n<Image\n  alt=\"Diagram showing how on-demand revalidation works, the Data Cache is updated with fresh data after a revalidation request.\"\n  srcLight=\"/docs/light/on-demand-revalidation.png\"\n  srcDark=\"/docs/dark/on-demand-revalidation.png\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"1082\"\n/>\n\n- The first time a `fetch` request is called, the data will be fetched from the external data source and stored in the Data Cache.\n- When an on-demand revalidation is triggered, the appropriate cache entries will be purged from the cache.\n  - This is different from time-based revalidation, which keeps the stale data in the cache until the fresh data is fetched.\n- The next time a request is made, it will be a cache `MISS` again, and the data will be fetched from the external data source and stored in the Data Cache.\n\n### Opting out\n\nFor individual data fetches, you can opt out of caching by setting the [`cache`](#fetch-optionscache) option to `no-store`. This means data will be fetched whenever `fetch` is called.\n\n```jsx\n// Opt out of caching for an individual `fetch` request\nfetch(`https://...`, { cache: 'no-store' })\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can also use the [Route Segment Config options](#segment-config-options) to opt out of caching for a specific route segment. This will affect all data requests in the route segment, including third-party libraries.\n\n```jsx\n// Opt out of caching for all data requests in the route segment\nexport const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'\n```\n\n> **Note**: Data Cache is currently only available in pages/routes, not middleware. Any fetches done inside of your middleware will be uncached by default.\n\n> **Vercel Data Cache**\n>\n> If your Next.js application is deployed to Vercel, we recommend reading the [Vercel Data Cache](https://vercel.com/docs/infrastructure/data-cache) documentation for a better understanding of Vercel specific features.\n\n## Full Route Cache\n\n> **Related terms**:\n>\n> You may see the terms **Automatic Static Optimization**, **Static Site Generation**, or **Static Rendering** being used interchangeably to refer to the process of rendering and caching routes of your application at build time.\n\nNext.js automatically renders and caches routes at build time. This is an optimization that allows you to serve the cached route instead of rendering on the server for every request, resulting in faster page loads.\n\nTo understand how the Full Route Cache works, it's helpful to look at how React handles rendering, and how Next.js caches the result:\n\n### 1. React Rendering on the Server\n\nOn the server, Next.js uses React's APIs to orchestrate rendering. The rendering work is split into chunks: by individual routes segments and Suspense boundaries.\n\nEach chunk is rendered in two steps:\n\n1. React renders Server Components into a special data format, optimized for streaming, called the **React Server Component Payload**.\n2. Next.js uses the React Server Component Payload and Client Component JavaScript instructions to render **HTML** on the server.\n\nThis means we don't have to wait for everything to render before caching the work or sending a response. Instead, we can stream a response as work is completed.\n\n> **What is the React Server Component Payload?**\n>\n> The React Server Component Payload is a compact binary representation of the rendered React Server Components tree. It's used by React on the client to update the browser's DOM. The React Server Component Payload contains:\n>\n> - The rendered result of Server Components\n> - Placeholders for where Client Components should be rendered and references to their JavaScript files\n> - Any props passed from a Server Component to a Client Component\n>\n> To learn more, see the [Server Components](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components) documentation.\n\n### 2. Next.js Caching on the Server (Full Route Cache)\n\n<Image\n  alt=\"Default behavior of the Full Route Cache, showing how the React Server Component Payload and HTML are cached on the server for statically rendered routes.\"\n  srcLight=\"/docs/light/full-route-cache.png\"\n  srcDark=\"/docs/dark/full-route-cache.png\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"888\"\n/>\n\nThe default behavior of Next.js is to cache the rendered result (React Server Component Payload and HTML) of a route on the server. This applies to statically rendered routes at build time, or during revalidation.\n\n### 3. React Hydration and Reconciliation on the Client\n\nAt request time, on the client:\n\n1. The HTML is used to immediately show a fast non-interactive initial preview of the Client and Server Components.\n2. The React Server Components Payload is used to reconcile the Client and rendered Server Component trees, and update the DOM.\n3. The JavaScript instructions are used to [hydrate](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/client/hydrateRoot) Client Components and make the application interactive.\n\n### 4. Next.js Caching on the Client (Router Cache)\n\nThe React Server Component Payload is stored in the client-side [Router Cache](#client-side-router-cache) - a separate in-memory cache, split by individual route segment. This Router Cache is used to improve the navigation experience by storing previously visited routes and prefetching future routes.\n\n### 5. Subsequent Navigations\n\nOn subsequent navigations or during prefetching, Next.js will check if the React Server Components Payload is stored in the Router Cache. If so, it will skip sending a new request to the server.\n\nIf the route segments are not in the cache, Next.js will fetch the React Server Components Payload from the server, and populate the Router Cache on the client.\n\n### Static and Dynamic Rendering\n\nWhether a route is cached or not at build time depends on whether it's statically or dynamically rendered. Static routes are cached by default, whereas dynamic routes are rendered at request time, and not cached.\n\nThis diagram shows the difference between statically and dynamically rendered routes, with cached and uncached data:\n\n<Image\n  alt=\"How static and dynamic rendering affects the Full Route Cache. Static routes are cached at build time or after data revalidation, whereas dynamic routes are never cached\"\n  srcLight=\"/docs/light/static-and-dynamic-routes.png\"\n  srcDark=\"/docs/dark/static-and-dynamic-routes.png\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"1314\"\n/>\n\nLearn more about [static and dynamic rendering](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components#server-rendering-strategies).\n\n### Duration\n\nBy default, the Full Route Cache is persistent. This means that the render output is cached across user requests.\n\n### Invalidation\n\nThere are two ways you can invalidate the Full Route Cache:\n\n- **[Revalidating Data](/docs/app/building-your-application/caching#revalidating)**: Revalidating the [Data Cache](#data-cache), will in turn invalidate the Router Cache by re-rendering components on the server and caching the new render output.\n- **Redeploying**: Unlike the Data Cache, which persists across deployments, the Full Route Cache is cleared on new deployments.\n\n### Opting out\n\nYou can opt out of the Full Route Cache, or in other words, dynamically render components for every incoming request, by:\n\n- **Using a [Dynamic Function](#dynamic-functions)**: This will opt the route out from the Full Route Cache and dynamically render it at request time. The Data Cache can still be used.\n- **Using the `dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` or `revalidate = 0` route segment config options**: This will skip the Full Route Cache and the Data Cache. Meaning components will be rendered and data fetched on every incoming request to the server. The Router Cache will still apply as it's a client-side cache.\n- **Opting out of the [Data Cache](#data-cache)**: If a route has a `fetch` request that is not cached, this will opt the route out of the Full Route Cache. The data for the specific `fetch` request will be fetched for every incoming request. Other `fetch` requests that do not opt out of caching will still be cached in the Data Cache. This allows for a hybrid of cached and uncached data.\n\n## Client-side Router Cache\n\nNext.js has an in-memory client-side router cache that stores the RSC payload of route segments, split by layouts, loading states, and pages.\n\nWhen a user navigates between routes, Next.js caches the visited route segments and [prefetches](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/linking-and-navigating#2-prefetching) the routes the user is likely to navigate to.This results in instant back/forward navigation, no full-page reload between navigations, and preservation of React state and browser state.\n\nWith the Router Cache:\n\n- **Layouts** are cached and reused on navigation ([partial rendering](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/linking-and-navigating#4-partial-rendering)).\n- **Loading states** are cached and reused on navigation for [instant navigation](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/loading-ui-and-streaming#instant-loading-states).\n- **Pages** are not cached by default, but are reused during browser backward and forward navigation. You can enable caching for page segments by using the experimental [`staleTimes`](/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/staleTimes) config option.\n\n{/* TODO: Update diagram to match v15 behavior */}\n\n> **Good to know:** This cache specifically applies to Next.js and Server Components, and is different to the browser's [bfcache](https://web.dev/bfcache/), though it has a similar result.\n\n### Duration\n\nThe cache is stored in the browser's temporary memory. Two factors determine how long the router cache lasts:\n\n- **Session**: The cache persists across navigation. However, it's cleared on page refresh.\n- **Automatic Invalidation Period**: The cache of layouts and loading states is automatically invalidated after a specific time. The duration depends on how the resource was [prefetched](/docs/app/api-reference/components/link#prefetch):\n  - **Default Prefetching** (`prefetch={null}` or unspecified): 0 seconds\n  - **Full Prefetching**: (`prefetch={true}` or `router.prefetch`): 5 minutes\n\nWhile a page refresh will clear **all** cached segments, the automatic invalidation period only affects the individual segment from the time it was prefetched.\n\n> **Good to know**: The experimental [`staleTimes`](/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/staleTimes) config option can be used to enable caching of page segments.\n\n### Invalidation\n\nThere are two ways you can invalidate the Router Cache:\n\n- In a **Server Action**:\n  - Revalidating data on-demand by path with ([`revalidatePath`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/revalidatePath)) or by cache tag with ([`revalidateTag`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/revalidateTag))\n  - Using [`cookies.set`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/cookies#cookiessetname-value-options) or [`cookies.delete`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/cookies#deleting-cookies) invalidates the Router Cache to prevent routes that use cookies from becoming stale (e.g. authentication).\n- Calling [`router.refresh`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-router) will invalidate the Router Cache and make a new request to the server for the current route.\n\n### Opting out\n\nAs of Next.js 15, page segments are opted out by default.\n\n> **Good to know:** You can also opt out of [prefetching](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/linking-and-navigating#2-prefetching) by setting the `prefetch` prop of the `<Link>` component to `false`.\n\n## Cache Interactions\n\nWhen configuring the different caching mechanisms, it's important to understand how they interact with each other:\n\n### Data Cache and Full Route Cache\n\n- Revalidating or opting out of the Data Cache **will** invalidate the Full Route Cache, as the render output depends on data.\n- Invalidating or opting out of the Full Route Cache **does not** affect the Data Cache. You can dynamically render a route that has both cached and uncached data. This is useful when most of your page uses cached data, but you have a few components that rely on data that needs to be fetched at request time. You can dynamically render without worrying about the performance impact of re-fetching all the data.\n\n### Data Cache and Client-side Router cache\n\n- To immediately invalidate the Data Cache and Router cache, you can use [`revalidatePath`](#revalidatepath) or [`revalidateTag`](#fetch-optionsnexttags-and-revalidatetag) in a [Server Action](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions-and-mutations).\n- Revalidating the Data Cache in a [Route Handler](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-handlers) **will not** immediately invalidate the Router Cache as the Route Handler isn't tied to a specific route. This means Router Cache will continue to serve the previous payload until a hard refresh, or the automatic invalidation period has elapsed.\n\n## APIs\n\nThe following table provides an overview of how different Next.js APIs affect caching:\n\n| API                                                                     | Router Cache               | Full Route Cache      | Data Cache            | React Cache |\n| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- | ----------- |\n| [`<Link prefetch>`](#link)                                              | Cache                      |                       |                       |             |\n| [`router.prefetch`](#routerprefetch)                                    | Cache                      |                       |                       |             |\n| [`router.refresh`](#routerrefresh)                                      | Revalidate                 |                       |                       |             |\n| [`fetch`](#fetch)                                                       |                            |                       | Cache                 | Cache       |\n| [`fetch` `options.cache`](#fetch-optionscache)                          |                            |                       | Cache or Opt out      |             |\n| [`fetch` `options.next.revalidate`](#fetch-optionsnextrevalidate)       |                            | Revalidate            | Revalidate            |             |\n| [`fetch` `options.next.tags`](#fetch-optionsnexttags-and-revalidatetag) |                            | Cache                 | Cache                 |             |\n| [`revalidateTag`](#fetch-optionsnexttags-and-revalidatetag)             | Revalidate (Server Action) | Revalidate            | Revalidate            |             |\n| [`revalidatePath`](#revalidatepath)                                     | Revalidate (Server Action) | Revalidate            | Revalidate            |             |\n| [`const revalidate`](#segment-config-options)                           |                            | Revalidate or Opt out | Revalidate or Opt out |             |\n| [`const dynamic`](#segment-config-options)                              |                            | Cache or Opt out      | Cache or Opt out      |             |\n| [`cookies`](#cookies)                                                   | Revalidate (Server Action) | Opt out               |                       |             |\n| [`headers`, `searchParams`](#dynamic-functions)                         |                            | Opt out               |                       |             |\n| [`generateStaticParams`](#generatestaticparams)                         |                            | Cache                 |                       |             |\n| [`React.cache`](#react-cache-function)                                  |                            |                       |                       | Cache       |\n| [`unstable_cache`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/unstable_cache)    |                            |                       | Cache                 |             |\n\n### `<Link>`\n\nBy default, the `<Link>` component automatically prefetches routes from the Full Route Cache and adds the React Server Component Payload to the Router Cache.\n\nTo disable prefetching, you can set the `prefetch` prop to `false`. But this will not skip the cache permanently, the route segment will still be cached client-side when the user visits the route.\n\nLearn more about the [`<Link>` component](/docs/app/api-reference/components/link).\n\n### `router.prefetch`\n\nThe `prefetch` option of the `useRouter` hook can be used to manually prefetch a route. This adds the React Server Component Payload to the Router Cache.\n\nSee the [`useRouter` hook](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-router) API reference.\n\n### `router.refresh`\n\nThe `refresh` option of the `useRouter` hook can be used to manually refresh a route. This completely clears the Router Cache, and makes a new request to the server for the current route. `refresh` does not affect the Data or Full Route Cache.\n\nThe rendered result will be reconciled on the client while preserving React state and browser state.\n\nSee the [`useRouter` hook](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-router) API reference.\n\n### `fetch`\n\nData returned from `fetch` is automatically cached in the Data Cache.\n\n```jsx\n// Cached by default. `force-cache` is the default option and can be omitted.\nfetch(`https://...`, { cache: 'force-cache' })\n```\n\nSee the [`fetch` API Reference](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/fetch) for more options.\n\n### `fetch options.cache`\n\nYou can opt out individual `fetch` requests of data caching by setting the `cache` option to `no-store`:\n\n```jsx\n// Opt out of caching\nfetch(`https://...`, { cache: 'no-store' })\n```\n\nSince the render output depends on data, using `cache: 'no-store'` will also skip the Full Route Cache for the route where the `fetch` request is used. That is, the route will be dynamically rendered every request, but you can still have other cached data requests in the same route.\n\nSee the [`fetch` API Reference](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/fetch) for more options.\n\n### `fetch options.next.revalidate`\n\nYou can use the `next.revalidate` option of `fetch` to set the revalidation period (in seconds) of an individual `fetch` request. This will revalidate the Data Cache, which in turn will revalidate the Full Route Cache. Fresh data will be fetched, and components will be re-rendered on the server.\n\n```jsx\n// Revalidate at most after 1 hour\nfetch(`https://...`, { next: { revalidate: 3600 } })\n```\n\nSee the [`fetch` API reference](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/fetch) for more options.\n\n### `fetch options.next.tags` and `revalidateTag`\n\nNext.js has a cache tagging system for fine-grained data caching and revalidation.\n\n1. When using `fetch` or [`unstable_cache`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/unstable_cache), you have the option to tag cache entries with one or more tags.\n2. Then, you can call `revalidateTag` to purge the cache entries associated with that tag.\n\nFor example, you can set a tag when fetching data:\n\n```jsx\n// Cache data with a tag\nfetch(`https://...`, { next: { tags: ['a', 'b', 'c'] } })\n```\n\nThen, call `revalidateTag` with a tag to purge the cache entry:\n\n```jsx\n// Revalidate entries with a specific tag\nrevalidateTag('a')\n```\n\nThere are two places you can use `revalidateTag`, depending on what you're trying to achieve:\n\n1. [Route Handlers](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-handlers) - to revalidate data in response of a third party event (e.g. webhook). This will not invalidate the Router Cache immediately as the Router Handler isn't tied to a specific route.\n2. [Server Actions](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions-and-mutations) - to revalidate data after a user action (e.g. form submission). This will invalidate the Router Cache for the associated route.\n\n### `revalidatePath`\n\n`revalidatePath` allows you manually revalidate data **and** re-render the route segments below a specific path in a single operation. Calling the `revalidatePath` method revalidates the Data Cache, which in turn invalidates the Full Route Cache.\n\n```jsx\nrevalidatePath('/')\n```\n\nThere are two places you can use `revalidatePath`, depending on what you're trying to achieve:\n\n1. [Route Handlers](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-handlers) - to revalidate data in response to a third party event (e.g. webhook).\n2. [Server Actions](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions-and-mutations) - to revalidate data after a user interaction (e.g. form submission, clicking a button).\n\nSee the [`revalidatePath` API reference](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/revalidatePath) for more information.\n\n> **`revalidatePath`** vs. **`router.refresh`**:\n>\n> Calling `router.refresh` will clear the Router cache, and re-render route segments on the server without invalidating the Data Cache or the Full Route Cache.\n>\n> The difference is that `revalidatePath` purges the Data Cache and Full Route Cache, whereas `router.refresh()` does not change the Data Cache and Full Route Cache, as it is a client-side API.\n\n### Dynamic Functions\n\nDynamic functions like `cookies` and `headers`, and the `searchParams` prop in Pages depend on runtime incoming request information. Using them will opt a route out of the Full Route Cache, in other words, the route will be dynamically rendered.\n\n#### `cookies`\n\nUsing `cookies.set` or `cookies.delete` in a Server Action invalidates the Router Cache to prevent routes that use cookies from becoming stale (e.g. to reflect authentication changes).\n\nSee the [`cookies`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/cookies) API reference.\n\n### Segment Config Options\n\nThe Route Segment Config options can be used to override the route segment defaults or when you're not able to use the `fetch` API (e.g. database client or 3rd party libraries).\n\nThe following Route Segment Config options will opt out of the Data Cache and Full Route Cache:\n\n- `const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'`\n- `const revalidate = 0`\n\nSee the [Route Segment Config](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/route-segment-config) documentation for more options.\n\n### `generateStaticParams`\n\nFor [dynamic segments](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes) (e.g. `app/blog/[slug]/page.js`), paths provided by `generateStaticParams` are cached in the Full Route Cache at build time. At request time, Next.js will also cache paths that weren't known at build time the first time they're visited.\n\nYou can disable caching at request time by using `export const dynamicParams = false` option in a route segment. When this config option is used, only paths provided by `generateStaticParams` will be served, and other routes will 404 or match (in the case of [catch-all routes](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes#catch-all-segments)).\n\nSee the [`generateStaticParams` API reference](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-static-params).\n\n### React `cache` function\n\nThe React `cache` function allows you to memoize the return value of a function, allowing you to call the same function multiple times while only executing it once.\n\nSince `fetch` requests are automatically memoized, you do not need to wrap it in React `cache`. However, you can use `cache` to manually memoize data requests for use cases when the `fetch` API is not suitable. For example, some database clients, CMS clients, or GraphQL clients.\n\n```tsx filename=\"utils/get-item.ts\" switcher\nimport { cache } from 'react'\nimport db from '@/lib/db'\n\nexport const getItem = cache(async (id: string) => {\n  const item = await db.item.findUnique({ id })\n  return item\n})\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"utils/get-item.js\" switcher\nimport { cache } from 'react'\nimport db from '@/lib/db'\n\nexport const getItem = cache(async (id) => {\n  const item = await db.item.findUnique({ id })\n  return item\n})\n```\n"},{"path":"docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/11-upgrading/02-version-15.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/11-upgrading/02-version-15.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/upgrading/version-15","sha":"8a51e0d186c122599acafba0ffc0fa8f44ae3e59","size":4893,"content":"---\ntitle: Version 15\ndescription: Upgrade your Next.js Application from Version 14 to 15.\n---\n\n{/* The content of this doc is shared between the app and pages router.

If individual `fetch` requests specify a `cache` option, that will be used instead.\n\n```js filename=\"app/layout.js\"\n// Since this is the root layout, all fetch requests in the app\n// that don't set their own cache option will be cached.\nexport const fetchCache = 'default-cache'\n\nexport default async function RootLayout() {\n  const a = await fetch('https://...') // Cached\n  const b = await fetch('https://...', { cache: 'no-store' }) // Not cached\n\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n## Route Handlers\n\n`GET` functions in [Route Handlers](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/route) are no longer cached by default. To opt `GET` methods into caching, you can use a [route config option](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/route-segment-config) such as `export const dynamic = 'force-static'` in your Route Handler file.\n\n```js filename=\"app/api/route.js\"\nexport const dynamic = 'force-static'\n\nexport async function GET() {}\n```\n\n## Client-side Router Cache\n\nWhen navigating between pages via `<Link>` or `useRouter`, [page](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/page) segments are no longer reused from the client-side router cache. However, they are still reused during browser backward and forward navigation and for shared layouts.\n\nTo opt page segments into caching, you can use the [`staleTimes`](/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/staleTimes) config option:\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\n/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */\nconst nextConfig = {\n  experimental: {\n    staleTimes: {\n      dynamic: 30,\n      static: 180,\n    },\n  },\n}\n\nmodule.exports = nextConfig\n```\n\n[Layouts](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/layout) and [loading states](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/loading) are still cached and reused on navigation.\n\n## `next/font`\n\nThe `@next/font` package has been removed in favor of the built-in [`next/font`](/docs/app/api-reference/components/font).

Also renames `next/future/image` to `next/image`.\n\nFor example:\n\n```jsx filename=\"pages/index.js\"\nimport Image1 from 'next/image'\nimport Image2 from 'next/future/image'\n\nexport default function Home() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <Image1 src=\"/test.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\" />\n      <Image2 src=\"/test.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"400\" />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nTransforms into:\n\n```jsx filename=\"pages/index.js\"\n// 'next/image' becomes 'next/legacy/image'\nimport Image1 from 'next/legacy/image'\n// 'next/future/image' becomes 'next/image'\nimport Image2 from 'next/image'\n\nexport default function Home() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <Image1 src=\"/test.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\" />\n      <Image2 src=\"/test.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"400\" />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n#### Migrate to the New Image Component\n\n##### `next-image-experimental`\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nnpx @next/codemod@latest next-image-experimental .\n```\n\nDangerously migrates from `next/legacy/image` to the new `next/image` by adding inline styles and removing unused props.\n\n- Removes `layout` prop and adds `style`.\n- Removes `objectFit` prop and adds `style`.\n- Removes `objectPosition` prop and adds `style`.\n- Removes `lazyBoundary` prop.\n- Removes `lazyRoot` prop.\n\n#### Remove `<a>` Tags From Link Components\n\n##### `new-link`\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nnpx @next/codemod@latest new-link .\n```\n\n<AppOnly>\n\nRemove `<a>` tags inside [Link Components](/docs/app/api-reference/components/link), or add a `legacyBehavior` prop to Links that cannot be auto-fixed.\n\n</AppOnly>\n\n<PagesOnly>\n\nRemove `<a>` tags inside [Link Components](/docs/pages/api-reference/components/link), or add a `legacyBehavior` prop to Links that cannot be auto-fixed.\n\n</PagesOnly>\n\nFor example:\n\n```jsx\n<Link href=\"/about\">\n  <a>About</a>\n</Link>\n// transforms into\n<Link href=\"/about\">\n  About\n</Link>\n\n<Link href=\"/about\">\n  <a onClick={() => console.log('clicked')}>About</a>\n</Link>\n// transforms into\n<Link href=\"/about\" onClick={() => console.log('clicked')}>\n  About\n</Link>\n```\n\nIn cases where auto-fixing can't be applied, the `legacyBehavior` prop is added. This allows your app to keep functioning using the old behavior for that particular link.\n\n```jsx\nconst Component = () => <a>About</a>\n\n<Link href=\"/about\">\n  <Component />\n</Link>\n// becomes\n<Link href=\"/about\" legacyBehavior>\n  <Component />\n</Link>\n```\n\n### 11\n\n#### Migrate from CRA\n\n##### `cra-to-next`\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nnpx @next/codemod cra-to-next\n```\n\nMigrates a Create React App project to Next.js; creating a Pages Router and necessary config to match behavior. Client-side only rendering is leveraged initially to prevent breaking compatibility due to `window` usage during SSR and can be enabled seamlessly to allow the gradual adoption of Next.js specific features.\n\nPlease share any feedback related to this transform [in this discussion](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/25858).\n\n### 10\n\n#### Add React imports\n\n##### `add-missing-react-import`\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nnpx @next/codemod add-missing-react-import\n```\n\nTransforms files that do not import `React` to include the import in order for the new [React JSX transform](https://reactjs.org/blog/2020/09/22/introducing-the-new-jsx-transform.html) to work.\n\nFor example:\n\n```jsx filename=\"my-component.js\"\nexport default class Home extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return <div>Hello World</div>\n  }\n}\n```\n\nTransforms into:\n\n```jsx filename=\"my-component.js\"\nimport React from 'react'\nexport default class Home extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return <div>Hello World</div>\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 9\n\n#### Transform Anonymous Components into Named Components\n\n##### `name-default-component`\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nnpx @next/codemod name-default-component\n```\n\n**Versions 9 and above.**\n\nTransforms anonymous components into named components to make sure they work with [Fast Refresh](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-9-4#fast-refresh).\n\nFor example:\n\n```jsx filename=\"my-component.js\"\nexport default function () {\n  return <div>Hello World</div>\n}\n```\n\nTransforms into:\n\n```jsx filename=\"my-component.js\"\nexport default function MyComponent() {\n  return <div>Hello World</div>\n}\n```\n\nThe component will have a camel-cased name based on the name of the file, and it also works with arrow functions.\n\n### 8\n\n#### Transform AMP HOC into page config\n\n##### `withamp-to-config`\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nnpx @next/codemod withamp-to-config\n```\n\nTransforms the `withAmp` HOC into Next.js 9 page configuration.\n\nFor example:\n\n```js\n// Before\nimport { withAmp } from 'next/amp'\n\nfunction Home() {\n  return <h1>My AMP Page</h1>\n}\n\nexport default withAmp(Home)\n```\n\n```js\n// After\nexport default function Home() {\n  return <h1>My AMP Page</h1>\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  amp: true,\n}\n```\n\n### 6\n\n#### Use `withRouter`\n\n##### `url-to-withrouter`\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nnpx @next/codemod url-to-withrouter\n```\n\nTransforms the deprecated automatically injected `url` property on top level pages to using `withRouter` and the `router` property it injects. Read more here: [https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/url-deprecated](/docs/messages/url-deprecated)\n\nFor example:\n\n```js filename=\"From\"\nimport React from 'react'\nexport default class extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    const { pathname } = this.props.url\n    return <div>Current pathname: {pathname}</div>\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"To\"\nimport React from 'react'\nimport { withRouter } from 'next/router'\nexport default withRouter(\n  class extends React.Component {\n    render() {\n      const { pathname } = this.props.router\n      return <div>Current pathname: {pathname}</div>\n    }\n  }\n)\n```\n\nThis is one case.

Client-side only applications, also known as single-page applications (SPAs), often experience slow initial page loading time. This happens due to a couple of reasons:\n\n1. The browser needs to wait for the React code and your entire application bundle to download and run before your code is able to send requests to load data.\n2. Your application code grows with every new feature and dependency you add.\n\n### No automatic code splitting\n\nThe previous issue of slow loading times can be somewhat managed with code splitting. However, if you try to do code splitting manually, you'll often make performance worse. It's easy to inadvertently introduce network waterfalls when code-splitting manually. Next.js provides automatic code splitting built into its router.\n\n### Network waterfalls\n\nA common cause of poor performance occurs when applications make sequential client-server requests to fetch data. One common pattern for data fetching in an SPA is to initially render a placeholder, and then fetch data after the component has mounted. Unfortunately, this means that a child component that fetches data can't start fetching until the parent component has finished loading its own data.\n\nWhile fetching data on the client is supported with Next.js, it also gives you the option to shift data fetching to the server, which can eliminate client-server waterfalls.\n\n### Fast and intentional loading states\n\nWith built-in support for [streaming through React Suspense](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/loading-ui-and-streaming#streaming-with-suspense), you can be more intentional about which parts of your UI you want to load first, and in what order, without introducing network waterfalls.\n\nThis enables you to build pages that are faster to load and eliminate [layout shifts](https://vercel.com/blog/how-core-web-vitals-affect-seo).\n\n### Choose the data fetching strategy\n\nDepending on your needs, Next.js allows you to choose your data fetching strategy on a page and component basis. You can decide to fetch at build time, at request time on the server, or on the client. For example, you can fetch data from your CMS and render your blog posts at build time, which can then be efficiently cached on a CDN.\n\n### Middleware\n\n[Next.js Middleware](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware) allows you to run code on the server before a request is completed. This is especially useful to avoid having a flash of unauthenticated content when the user visits an authenticated-only page by redirecting the user to a login page. The middleware is also useful for experimentation and [internationalization](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/internationalization).\n\n### Built-in optimizations\n\n[Images](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/images), [fonts](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts), and [third-party scripts](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/scripts) often have significant impact on an application's performance. Next.js comes with built-in components that automatically optimize those for you.\n\n## Migration steps\n\nOur goal with this migration is to get a working Next.js application as quickly as possible, so that you can then adopt Next.js features incrementally. To begin with, we'll keep it as a purely client-side application (SPA) without migrating your existing router. This helps minimize the chances of encountering issues during the migration process and reduces merge conflicts.\n\n### Step 1: Install Next.js\n\nThe first thing you need to do is to install `next` as a dependency:\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nnpm install next@latest\n```\n\n### Step 2: Create the Next.js configuration file\n\nCreate a `next.config.mjs` at the root of your project. This file will hold your [Next.js configuration options](/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js).\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.mjs\"\n/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */\nconst nextConfig = {\n  output: 'export', // Outputs a Single-Page Application (SPA).\n  distDir: './build', // Changes the build output directory to `./build/`.\n}\n\nexport default nextConfig\n```\n\n### Step 3: Update TypeScript configuration\n\nIf you're using TypeScript, you need to update your `tsconfig.json` file with the following changes to make it compatible with Next.js:\n\n```json filename=\"tsconfig.json\"\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"target\": \"es5\",\n    \"lib\": [\"dom\", \"dom.iterable\", \"esnext\"],\n    \"allowJs\": true,\n    \"skipLibCheck\": true,\n    \"strict\": false,\n    \"forceConsistentCasingInFileNames\": true,\n    \"noEmit\": true,\n    \"esModuleInterop\": true,\n    \"module\": \"esnext\",\n    \"moduleResolution\": \"node\",\n    \"resolveJsonModule\": true,\n    \"isolatedModules\": true,\n    \"jsx\": \"preserve\",\n    \"baseUrl\": \".\",\n    \"incremental\": true,\n    \"plugins\": [\n      {\n        \"name\": \"next\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"strictNullChecks\": true\n  },\n  \"include\": [\n    \"next-env.d.ts\",\n    \"**/*.ts\",\n    \"**/*.tsx\",\n    \".next/types/**/*.ts\",\n    \"./dist/types/**/*.ts\"\n  ],\n  \"exclude\": [\"node_modules\"]\n}\n```\n\nYou can find more information about configuring TypeScript on the [Next.js docs](/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/typescript#typescript-plugin).\n\n### Step 4: Create the Root Layout\n\nA Next.js [App Router](/docs/app) application must include a [root layout](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/layouts-and-templates#root-layout-required) file, which is a [React Server Component](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components) that will wrap all pages in your application. This file is defined at the top level of the `app` directory.\n\nThe closest equivalent to the root layout file in a CRA application is the `index.html` file, which contains your `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.\n\nIn this step, you'll convert your `index.html` file into a root layout file:\n\n1. Create a new `app` directory in your `src` directory.\n2. Create a new `layout.tsx` file inside that `app` directory:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/layout.tsx\" switcher\nexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return null\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/layout.js\" switcher\nexport default function RootLayout({ children }) {\n  return null\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know**: `.js`, `.jsx`, or `.tsx` extensions can be used for Layout files.\n\nCopy the content of your `index.html` file into the previously created `<RootLayout>` component while replacing the `body.div#root` and `body.script` tags with `<div id=\"root\">{children}</div>`:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/layout.tsx\" switcher\nexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <head>\n        <meta charSet=\"UTF-8\" />\n        <link rel=\"icon\" href=\"%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico\" />\n        <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" />\n        <title>React App</title>\n        <meta name=\"description\" content=\"Web site created...\" />\n      </head>\n      <body>\n        <div id=\"root\">{children}</div>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/layout.js\" switcher\nexport default function RootLayout({ children }) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <head>\n        <meta charset=\"UTF-8\" />\n        <link rel=\"icon\" href=\"%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico\" />\n        <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" />\n        <title>React App</title>\n        <meta name=\"description\" content=\"Web site created...\" />\n      </head>\n      <body>\n        <div id=\"root\">{children}</div>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know**: We'll ignore the [manifest file](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/metadata), additional iconography other than the favicon, and [testing configuration](/docs/app/building-your-application/testing), but if these are requirements, Next.js also supports these options.\n\n### Step 5: Metadata\n\nNext.js includes by default the [meta charset](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta#charset) and [meta viewport](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Viewport_meta_tag) tags, so you can safely remove those from your `<head>`:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/layout.tsx\" switcher\nexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <head>\n        <link rel=\"icon\" href=\"%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico\" />\n        <title>React App</title>\n        <meta name=\"description\" content=\"Web site created...\" />\n      </head>\n      <body>\n        <div id=\"root\">{children}</div>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/layout.js\" switcher\nexport default function RootLayout({ children }) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <head>\n        <link rel=\"icon\" href=\"%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico\" />\n        <title>React App</title>\n        <meta name=\"description\" content=\"Web site created...\" />\n      </head>\n      <body>\n        <div id=\"root\">{children}</div>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nAny [metadata files](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/metadata#file-based-metadata) such as `favicon.ico`, `icon.png`, `robots.txt` are automatically added to the application `<head>` tag as long as you have them placed into the top level of the `app` directory. After moving [all supported files](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/metadata#file-based-metadata) into the `app` directory you can safely delete their `<link>` tags:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/layout.tsx\" switcher\nexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <head>\n        <title>React App</title>\n        <meta name=\"description\" content=\"Web site created...\" />\n      </head>\n      <body>\n        <div id=\"root\">{children}</div>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/layout.js\" switcher\nexport default function RootLayout({ children }) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <head>\n        <title>React App</title>\n        <meta name=\"description\" content=\"Web site created...\" />\n      </head>\n      <body>\n        <div id=\"root\">{children}</div>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nFinally, Next.js can manage your last `<head>` tags with the [Metadata API](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/metadata). Move your final metadata info into an exported [`metadata` object](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-metadata#metadata-object):\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/layout.tsx\" switcher\nimport type { Metadata } from 'next'\n\nexport const metadata: Metadata = {\n  title: 'React App',\n  description: 'Web site created with Next.js.',\n}\n\nexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <body>\n        <div id=\"root\">{children}</div>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/layout.js\" switcher\nexport const metadata = {\n  title: 'React App',\n  description: 'Web site created with Next.js.',\n}\n\nexport default function RootLayout({ children }) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <body>\n        <div id=\"root\">{children}</div>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nWith the above changes, you shifted from declaring everything in your `index.html` to using Next.js' convention-based approach built into the framework ([Metadata API](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/metadata)). This approach enables you to more easily improve your SEO and web shareability of your pages.\n\n### Step 6: Styles\n\nLike Create React App, Next.js has built-in support for [CSS Modules](/docs/app/building-your-application/styling/css-modules).\n\nIf you're using a global CSS file, import it into your `app/layout.tsx` file:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/layout.tsx\" switcher\nimport '../index.css'\n\n// ...\n```\n\nIf you're using Tailwind, you'll need to install `postcss` and `autoprefixer`:\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nnpm install postcss autoprefixer\n```\n\nThen, create a `postcss.config.js` file at the root of your project:\n\n```js filename=\"postcss.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  plugins: {\n    tailwindcss: {},\n    autoprefixer: {},\n  },\n}\n```\n\nCreate a `` file at the root of your project:\n\n```ts filename=\"tailwind.config.ts\"\nimport type { Config } from 'tailwindcss'\n\nconst config: Config = {\n  content: [\n    './pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}',\n    './components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}',\n    './app/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}',\n  ],\n  theme: {},\n  plugins: [],\n}\nexport default config\n```\n\nCreate an `app/globals.css` and import Tailwind globals:\n\n```css filename=\"app/globals.css\"\n@tailwind base;\n@tailwind components;\n@tailwind utilities;\n```\n\nLastly, import the `globals.css` file in your `app/layout.tsx` file:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/layout.tsx\" switcher\nimport './globals.css'\n\n// ...\n```\n\n### Step 7: Create the entrypoint page\n\nOn Next.js you declare an entrypoint for your application by creating a `page.tsx` file. The closest equivalent of this file on CRA is your `src/index.tsx` file. In this step, you’ll set up the entry point of your application.\n\n**Create a `[[...slug]]` directory in your `app` directory.**\n\nSince this guide is aiming to first set up our Next.js as an SPA (Single Page Application), you need your page entry point to catch all possible routes of your application. For that, create a new `[[...slug]]` directory in your `app` directory.\n\nThis directory is what is called an [optional catch-all route segment](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes#optional-catch-all-segments). Next.js uses a file-system based router where [directories are used to define routes](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/defining-routes#creating-routes). This special directory will make sure that all routes of your application will be directed to its containing `page.tsx` file.\n\n**Create a new `page.tsx` file inside the `app/[[...slug]]` directory with the following content:**\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/[[...slug]]/page.tsx\" switcher\nimport '../../index.css'\n\nexport function generateStaticParams() {\n  return [{ slug: [''] }]\n}\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return '...' // We'll update this\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/[[...slug]]/page.js\" switcher\nimport '../../index.css'\n\nexport function generateStaticParams() {\n  return [{ slug: [''] }]\n}\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return '...' // We'll update this\n}\n```\n\nThis file is a [Server Component](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components). When you run `next build`, the file is prerendered into a static asset. It does _not_ require any dynamic code.\n\nThis file imports our global CSS and tells [`generateStaticParams`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-static-params) we are only going to generate one route, the index route at `/`.\n\nNow, let's move the rest of our CRA application which will run client-only.\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/[[...slug]]/client.tsx\" switcher\n'use client'\n\nimport React from 'react'\nimport dynamic from 'next/dynamic'\n\nconst App = dynamic(() => import('../../App'), { ssr: false })\n\nexport function ClientOnly() {\n  return <App />\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/[[...slug]]/client.js\" switcher\n'use client'\n\nimport React from 'react'\nimport dynamic from 'next/dynamic'\n\nconst App = dynamic(() => import('../../App'), { ssr: false })\n\nexport function ClientOnly() {\n  return <App />\n}\n```\n\nThis file is a [Client Component](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/client-components), defined by the `'use client'` directive. Client Components are still [prerendered to HTML](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/client-components#how-are-client-components-rendered) on the server before being sent to the client.\n\nSince we want a client-only application to start, we can configure Next.js to disable prerendering from the `App` component down.\n\n```tsx\nconst App = dynamic(() => import('../../App'), { ssr: false })\n```\n\nNow, update your entrypoint page to use the new component:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/[[...slug]]/page.tsx\" switcher\nimport '../../index.css'\nimport { ClientOnly } from './client'\n\nexport function generateStaticParams() {\n  return [{ slug: [''] }]\n}\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return <ClientOnly />\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/[[...slug]]/page.js\" switcher\nimport '../../index.css'\nimport { ClientOnly } from './client'\n\nexport function generateStaticParams() {\n  return [{ slug: [''] }]\n}\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return <ClientOnly />\n}\n```\n\n### Step 8: Update static image imports\n\nNext.js handles static image imports slightly different from CRA. With CRA, importing an image file will return its public URL as a string:\n\n```tsx filename=\"App.tsx\"\nimport image from './img.png'\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return <img src={image} />\n}\n```\n\nWith Next.js, static image imports return an object. The object can then be used directly with the Next.js [`<Image>` component](/docs/app/api-reference/components/image), or you can use the object's `src` property with your existing `<img>` tag.\n\nThe `<Image>` component has the added benefits of [automatic image optimization](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/images). The `<Image>` component automatically sets the `width` and `height` attributes of the resulting `<img>` based on the image's dimensions. This prevents layout shifts when the image loads. However, this can cause issues if your app contains images with only one of their dimensions being styled without the other styled to `auto`. When not styled to `auto`, the dimension will default to the `<img>` dimension attribute's value, which can cause the image to appear distorted.\n\nKeeping the `<img>` tag will reduce the amount of changes in your application and prevent the above issues. You can then optionally later migrate to the `<Image>` component to take advantage of optimizing images by [configuring a loader](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/images#loaders), or moving to the default Next.js server which has automatic image optimization.\n\n**Convert absolute import paths for images imported from `/public` into relative imports:**\n\n```tsx\n// Before\nimport logo from '/logo.png'\n\n// After\nimport logo from '../public/logo.png'\n```\n\n**Pass the image `src` property instead of the whole image object to your `<img>` tag:**\n\n```tsx\n// Before\n<img src={logo} />\n\n// After\n<img src={logo.src} />\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can reference the public URL for the image asset based on the filename. For example, `public/logo.png` will serve the image at `/logo.png` for your application, which would be the `src` value.\n\n> **Warning:** If you're using TypeScript, you might encounter type errors when accessing the `src` property. You can safely ignore those for now. They will be fixed by the end of this guide.\n\n### Step 9: Migrate the environment variables\n\nNext.js has support for `.env` [environment variables](/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/environment-variables) similar to CRA.\n\nThe main difference is the prefix used to expose environment variables on the client-side. Change all environment variables with the `REACT_APP_` prefix to `NEXT_PUBLIC_`.\n\n### Step 10: Update scripts in `package.json`\n\nYou are almost ready to run your application and test if you successfully migrated to Next.js.\n\nBut before that, you need to update your `scripts` in your `package.json` with Next.js related commands.\n\n```json filename=\"package.json\"\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"dev\": \"next dev\",\n    \"build\": \"next build\",\n    \"start\": \"next start\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAnd add `.next`, `next-env.d.ts`, and `build` to your `.gitignore` file.\n\n```txt filename=\".gitignore\"\n# ...\n.next\nnext-env.d.ts\nbuild\n```\n\nNow, run `npm run dev`, and open [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000). You should see your application now running on Next.js.\n\n### Step 11: Clean up\n\nYou can now clean up your codebase from Create React App related artifacts:\n\n- Delete `src/index.tsx`\n- Delete `public/index.html`\n- Delete `reportWebVitals` setup\n- Uninstall CRA dependencies (`react-scripts`)\n\n## Bundler compatibility\n\nCreate React App and Next.js both default to using webpack for bundling.\n\nWhen migrating your CRA application to Next.js, you might have a custom webpack configuration you're looking to migrate. Next.js supports providing a [custom webpack configuration](/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/webpack).\n\nFurther, Next.js has support for [Turbopack](/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/turbo) through `next dev --turbo` to improve your local dev performance. Turbopack supports some [webpack loaders](/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/turbo) as well for compatibility and incremental adoption.\n\n## Next steps\n\nIf everything went according to plan, you now have a functioning Next.js application running as a single-page application. However, you aren't yet taking advantage of most of Next.js' benefits, but you can now start making incremental changes to reap all the benefits. Here's what you might want to do next:\n\n- Migrate from React Router to the [Next.js App Router](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing) to get:\n  - Automatic code splitting\n  - [Streaming Server-Rendering](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/loading-ui-and-streaming)\n  - [React Server Components](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components)\n- [Optimize images with the `<Image>` component](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/images)\n- [Optimize fonts with `next/font`](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts)\n- [Optimize third-party scripts with the `<Script>` component](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/scripts)\n- [Update your ESLint configuration to support Next.js rules](/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/eslint)\n\n> **Good to know:** Using a static export [does not currently support](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/54393) using the `useParams` hook.\n"},{"path":"docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/11-upgrading/04-app-router-migration.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/11-upgrading/04-app-router-migration.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/upgrading/app-router-migration","sha":"ecc053be4f0a6fb68d31f7daa0f70b896a35cac9","size":37081,"content":"---\ntitle: App Router Incremental Adoption Guide\nnav_title: App Router Migration\ndescription: Learn how to upgrade your existing Next.js application from the Pages Router to the App Router.\n---\n\nThis guide will help you:\n\n- [Update your Next.js application from version 12 to version 13](#nextjs-version)\n- [Upgrade features that work in both the `pages` and the `app` directories](#upgrading-new-features)\n- [Incrementally migrate your existing application from `pages` to `app`](#migrating-from-pages-to-app)\n\n## Upgrading\n\n### Node.js Version\n\nThe minimum Node.js version is now **v18.17**. See the [Node.js documentation](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v18.x/api/) for more information.\n\n### Next.js Version\n\nTo update to Next.js version 13, run the following command using your preferred package manager:\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nnpm install next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest\n```\n\n### ESLint Version\n\nIf you're using ESLint, you need to upgrade your ESLint version:\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nnpm install -D eslint-config-next@latest\n```\n\n> **Good to know**: You may need to restart the ESLint server in VS Code for the ESLint changes to take effect. Open the Command Palette (`cmd+shift+p` on Mac; `ctrl+shift+p` on Windows) and search for `ESLint: Restart ESLint Server`.\n\n## Next Steps\n\nAfter you've updated, see the following sections for next steps:\n\n- [Upgrade new features](#upgrading-new-features): A guide to help you upgrade to new features such as the improved Image and Link Components.\n- [Migrate from the `pages` to `app` directory](#migrating-from-pages-to-app): A step-by-step guide to help you incrementally migrate from the `pages` to the `app` directory.\n\n## Upgrading New Features\n\nNext.js 13 introduced the new [App Router](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing) with new features and conventions. The new Router is available in the `app` directory and co-exists with the `pages` directory.\n\nUpgrading to Next.js 13 does **not** require using the new [App Router](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing#the-app-router). You can continue using `pages` with new features that work in both directories, such as the updated [Image component](#image-component), [Link component](#link-component), [Script component](#script-component), and [Font optimization](#font-optimization).\n\n### `<Image/>` Component\n\nNext.js 12 introduced new improvements to the Image Component with a temporary import: `next/future/image`. These improvements included less client-side JavaScript, easier ways to extend and style images, better accessibility, and native browser lazy loading.\n\nIn version 13, this new behavior is now the default for `next/image`.\n\nThere are two codemods to help you migrate to the new Image Component:\n\n- [**`next-image-to-legacy-image` codemod**](/docs/app/building-your-application/upgrading/codemods#next-image-to-legacy-image): Safely and automatically renames `next/image` imports to `next/legacy/image`. Existing components will maintain the same behavior.\n- [**`next-image-experimental` codemod**](/docs/app/building-your-application/upgrading/codemods#next-image-experimental): Dangerously adds inline styles and removes unused props. This will change the behavior of existing components to match the new defaults. To use this codemod, you need to run the `next-image-to-legacy-image` codemod first.\n\n### `<Link>` Component\n\nThe [`<Link>` Component](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/linking-and-navigating#link-component) no longer requires manually adding an `<a>` tag as a child. This behavior was added as an experimental option in [version 12.2](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-12-2) and is now the default. In Next.js 13, `<Link>` always renders `<a>` and allows you to forward props to the underlying tag.\n\nFor example:\n\n```jsx\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n\n// Next.js 12: `<a>` has to be nested otherwise it's excluded\n<Link href=\"/about\">\n  <a>About</a>\n</Link>\n\n// Next.js 13: `<Link>` always renders `<a>` under the hood\n<Link href=\"/about\">\n  About\n</Link>\n```\n\nTo upgrade your links to Next.js 13, you can use the [`new-link` codemod](/docs/app/building-your-application/upgrading/codemods#new-link).\n\n### `<Script>` Component\n\nThe behavior of [`next/script`](/docs/app/api-reference/components/script) has been updated to support both `pages` and `app`, but some changes need to be made to ensure a smooth migration:\n\n- Move any `beforeInteractive` scripts you previously included in `_document.js` to the root layout file (`app/layout.tsx`).\n- The experimental `worker` strategy does not yet work in `app` and scripts denoted with this strategy will either have to be removed or modified to use a different strategy (e.g. `lazyOnload`).\n- `onLoad`, `onReady`, and `onError` handlers will not work in Server Components so make sure to move them to a [Client Component](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components) or remove them altogether.\n\n### Font Optimization\n\nPreviously, Next.js helped you optimize fonts by [inlining font CSS](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts). Version 13 introduces the new [`next/font`](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) module which gives you the ability to customize your font loading experience while still ensuring great performance and privacy. `next/font` is supported in both the `pages` and `app` directories.\n\nWhile [inlining CSS](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) still works in `pages`, it does not work in `app`. You should use [`next/font`](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) instead.\n\nSee the [Font Optimization](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) page to learn how to use `next/font`.\n\n## Migrating from `pages` to `app`\n\n> **🎥 Watch:** Learn how to incrementally adopt the App Router → [YouTube (16 minutes)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMSietiFm0).\n\nMoving to the App Router may be the first time using React features that Next.js builds on top of such as Server Components, Suspense, and more. When combined with new Next.js features such as [special files](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing#file-conventions) and [layouts](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/layouts-and-templates#layouts), migration means new concepts, mental models, and behavioral changes to learn.\n\nWe recommend reducing the combined complexity of these updates by breaking down your migration into smaller steps. The `app` directory is intentionally designed to work simultaneously with the `pages` directory to allow for incremental page-by-page migration.\n\n- The `app` directory supports nested routes _and_ layouts. [Learn more](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing).\n- Use nested folders to [define routes](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/defining-routes) and a special `page.js` file to make a route segment publicly accessible. [Learn more](#step-4-migrating-pages).\n- [Special file conventions](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing#file-conventions) are used to create UI for each route segment. The most common special files are `page.js` and `layout.js`.\n  - Use `page.js` to define UI unique to a route.\n  - Use `layout.js` to define UI that is shared across multiple routes.\n  - `.js`, `.jsx`, or `.tsx` file extensions can be used for special files.\n- You can colocate other files inside the `app` directory such as components, styles, tests, and more. [Learn more](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing).\n- Data fetching functions like `getServerSideProps` and `getStaticProps` have been replaced with [a new API](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching) inside `app`. `getStaticPaths` has been replaced with [`generateStaticParams`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-static-params).\n- `pages/_app.js` and `pages/_document.js` have been replaced with a single `app/layout.js` root layout. [Learn more](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/layouts-and-templates#root-layout-required).\n- `pages/_error.js` has been replaced with more granular `error.js` special files. [Learn more](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/error-handling).\n- `pages/404.js` has been replaced with the [`not-found.js`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/not-found) file.\n- `pages/api/*` API Routes have been replaced with the [`route.js`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/route) (Route Handler) special file.\n\n### Step 1: Creating the `app` directory\n\nUpdate to the latest Next.js version (requires 13.4 or greater):\n\n```bash\nnpm install next@latest\n```\n\nThen, create a new `app` directory at the root of your project (or `src/` directory).\n\n### Step 2: Creating a Root Layout\n\nCreate a new `app/layout.tsx` file inside the `app` directory. This is a [root layout](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/layouts-and-templates#root-layout-required) that will apply to all routes inside `app`.\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/layout.tsx\" switcher\nexport default function RootLayout({\n  // Layouts must accept a children prop.\n  // This will be populated with nested layouts or pages\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <body>{children}</body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/layout.js\" switcher\nexport default function RootLayout({\n  // Layouts must accept a children prop.\n  // This will be populated with nested layouts or pages\n  children,\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <body>{children}</body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n- The `app` directory **must** include a root layout.\n- The root layout must define `<html>`, and `<body>` tags since Next.js does not automatically create them\n- The root layout replaces the `pages/_app.tsx` and `pages/_document.tsx` files.\n- `.js`, `.jsx`, or `.tsx` extensions can be used for layout files.\n\nTo manage `<head>` HTML elements, you can use the [built-in SEO support](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/metadata):\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/layout.tsx\" switcher\nimport type { Metadata } from 'next'\n\nexport const metadata: Metadata = {\n  title: 'Home',\n  description: 'Welcome to Next.js',\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/layout.js\" switcher\nexport const metadata = {\n  title: 'Home',\n  description: 'Welcome to Next.js',\n}\n```\n\n#### Migrating `_document.js` and `_app.js`\n\nIf you have an existing `_app` or `_document` file, you can copy the contents (e.g. global styles) to the root layout (`app/layout.tsx`). Styles in `app/layout.tsx` will _not_ apply to `pages/*`. You should keep `_app`/`_document` while migrating to prevent your `pages/*` routes from breaking. Once fully migrated, you can then safely delete them.\n\nIf you are using any React Context providers, they will need to be moved to a [Client Component](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/client-components).\n\n#### Migrating the `getLayout()` pattern to Layouts (Optional)\n\nNext.js recommended adding a [property to Page components](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts#layout-pattern#per-page-layouts) to achieve per-page layouts in the `pages` directory. This pattern can be replaced with native support for [nested layouts](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/layouts-and-templates#layouts) in the `app` directory.\n\n<details>\n  <summary>See before and after example</summary>\n\n**Before**\n\n```jsx filename=\"components/DashboardLayout.js\"\nexport default function DashboardLayout({ children }) {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h2>My Dashboard</h2>\n      {children}\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"pages/dashboard/index.js\"\nimport DashboardLayout from '../components/DashboardLayout'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return <p>My Page</p>\n}\n\nPage.getLayout = function getLayout(page) {\n  return <DashboardLayout>{page}</DashboardLayout>\n}\n```\n\n**After**\n\n- Remove the `Page.getLayout` property from `pages/dashboard/index.js` and follow the [steps for migrating pages](#step-4-migrating-pages) to the `app` directory.\n\n  ```jsx filename=\"app/dashboard/page.js\"\n  export default function Page() {\n    return <p>My Page</p>\n  }\n  ```\n\n- Move the contents of `DashboardLayout` into a new [Client Component](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/client-components) to retain `pages` directory behavior.\n\n  ```jsx filename=\"app/dashboard/DashboardLayout.js\"\n  'use client' // this directive should be at top of the file, before any imports.\n\n  // This is a Client Component\n  export default function DashboardLayout({ children }) {\n    return (\n      <div>\n        <h2>My Dashboard</h2>\n        {children}\n      </div>\n    )\n  }\n  ```\n\n- Import the `DashboardLayout` into a new `layout.js` file inside the `app` directory.\n\n  ```jsx filename=\"app/dashboard/layout.js\"\n  import DashboardLayout from './DashboardLayout'\n\n  // This is a Server Component\n  export default function Layout({ children }) {\n    return <DashboardLayout>{children}</DashboardLayout>\n  }\n  ```\n\n- You can incrementally move non-interactive parts of `DashboardLayout.js` (Client Component) into `layout.js` (Server Component) to reduce the amount of component JavaScript you send to the client.\n\n</details>\n\n### Step 3: Migrating `next/head`\n\nIn the `pages` directory, the `next/head` React component is used to manage `<head>` HTML elements such as `title` and `meta` . In the `app` directory, `next/head` is replaced with the new [built-in SEO support](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/metadata).\n\n**Before:**\n\n```tsx filename=\"pages/index.tsx\" switcher\nimport Head from 'next/head'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Head>\n        <title>My page title</title>\n      </Head>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"pages/index.js\" switcher\nimport Head from 'next/head'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Head>\n        <title>My page title</title>\n      </Head>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n**After:**\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/page.tsx\" switcher\nimport type { Metadata } from 'next'\n\nexport const metadata: Metadata = {\n  title: 'My Page Title',\n}\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return '...'\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/page.js\" switcher\nexport const metadata = {\n  title: 'My Page Title',\n}\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return '...'\n}\n```\n\n[See all metadata options](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-metadata).\n\n### Step 4: Migrating Pages\n\n- Pages in the [`app` directory](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing) are [Server Components](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components) by default. This is different from the `pages` directory where pages are [Client Components](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/client-components).\n- [Data fetching](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching) has changed in `app`. `getServerSideProps`, `getStaticProps` and `getInitialProps` have been replaced with a simpler API.\n- The `app` directory uses nested folders to [define routes](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/defining-routes) and a special `page.js` file to make a route segment publicly accessible.\n- | `pages` Directory | `app` Directory       | Route          |\n  | ----------------- | --------------------- | -------------- |\n  | `index.js`        | `page.js`             | `/`            |\n  | `about.js`        | `about/page.js`       | `/about`       |\n  | `blog/[slug].js`  | `blog/[slug]/page.js` | `/blog/post-1` |\n\nWe recommend breaking down the migration of a page into two main steps:\n\n- Step 1: Move the default exported Page Component into a new Client Component.\n- Step 2: Import the new Client Component into a new `page.js` file inside the `app` directory.\n\n> **Good to know**: This is the easiest migration path because it has the most comparable behavior to the `pages` directory.\n\n**Step 1: Create a new Client Component**\n\n- Create a new separate file inside the `app` directory (i.e. `app/home-page.tsx` or similar) that exports a Client Component. To define Client Components, add the `'use client'` directive to the top of the file (before any imports).\n  - Similar to the Pages Router, there is an [optimization step](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/client-components#full-page-load) to prerender Client Components to static HTML on the initial page load.\n- Move the default exported page component from `pages/index.js` to `app/home-page.tsx`.\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/home-page.tsx\" switcher\n'use client'\n\n// This is a Client Component (same as components in the `pages` directory)\n// It receives data as props, has access to state and effects, and is\n// prerendered on the server during the initial page load.\nexport default function HomePage({ recentPosts }) {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      {recentPosts.map((post) => (\n        <div key={post.id}>{post.title}</div>\n      ))}\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/home-page.js\" switcher\n'use client'\n\n// This is a Client Component. It receives data as props and\n// has access to state and effects just like Page components\n// in the `pages` directory.\nexport default function HomePage({ recentPosts }) {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      {recentPosts.map((post) => (\n        <div key={post.id}>{post.title}</div>\n      ))}\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n**Step 2: Create a new page**\n\n- Create a new `app/page.tsx` file inside the `app` directory. This is a Server Component by default.\n- Import the `home-page.tsx` Client Component into the page.\n- If you were fetching data in `pages/index.js`, move the data fetching logic directly into the Server Component using the new [data fetching APIs](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/caching-and-revalidating). See the [data fetching upgrade guide](#step-6-migrating-data-fetching-methods) for more details.\n\n  ```tsx filename=\"app/page.tsx\" switcher\n  // Import your Client Component\n  import HomePage from './home-page'\n\n  async function getPosts() {\n    const res = await fetch('https://...')\n    const posts = await res.json()\n    return posts\n  }\n\n  export default async function Page() {\n    // Fetch data directly in a Server Component\n    const recentPosts = await getPosts()\n    // Forward fetched data to your Client Component\n    return <HomePage recentPosts={recentPosts} />\n  }\n  ```\n\n  ```jsx filename=\"app/page.js\" switcher\n  // Import your Client Component\n  import HomePage from './home-page'\n\n  async function getPosts() {\n    const res = await fetch('https://...')\n    const posts = await res.json()\n    return posts\n  }\n\n  export default async function Page() {\n    // Fetch data directly in a Server Component\n    const recentPosts = await getPosts()\n    // Forward fetched data to your Client Component\n    return <HomePage recentPosts={recentPosts} />\n  }\n  ```\n\n- If your previous page used `useRouter`, you'll need to update to the new routing hooks. [Learn more](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-router).\n- Start your development server and visit [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000). You should see your existing index route, now served through the app directory.\n\n### Step 5: Migrating Routing Hooks\n\nA new router has been added to support the new behavior in the `app` directory.\n\nIn `app`, you should use the three new hooks imported from `next/navigation`: [`useRouter()`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-router), [`usePathname()`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-pathname), and [`useSearchParams()`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-search-params).\n\n- The new `useRouter` hook is imported from `next/navigation` and has different behavior to the `useRouter` hook in `pages` which is imported from `next/router`.\n  - The [`useRouter` hook imported from `next/router`](/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/use-router) is not supported in the `app` directory but can continue to be used in the `pages` directory.\n- The new `useRouter` does not return the `pathname` string. Use the separate `usePathname` hook instead.\n- The new `useRouter` does not return the `query` object. Use the separate `useSearchParams` hook instead.\n- You can use `useSearchParams` and `usePathname` together to listen to page changes. See the [Router Events](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-router#router-events) section for more details.\n- These new hooks are only supported in Client Components. They cannot be used in Server Components.\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/example-client-component.tsx\" switcher\n'use client'\n\nimport { useRouter, usePathname, useSearchParams } from 'next/navigation'\n\nexport default function ExampleClientComponent() {\n  const router = useRouter()\n  const pathname = usePathname()\n  const searchParams = useSearchParams()\n\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/example-client-component.js\" switcher\n'use client'\n\nimport { useRouter, usePathname, useSearchParams } from 'next/navigation'\n\nexport default function ExampleClientComponent() {\n  const router = useRouter()\n  const pathname = usePathname()\n  const searchParams = useSearchParams()\n\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\nIn addition, the new `useRouter` hook has the following changes:\n\n- `isFallback` has been removed because `fallback` has [been replaced](#replacing-fallback).\n- The `locale`, `locales`, `defaultLocales`, `domainLocales` values have been removed because built-in i18n Next.js features are no longer necessary in the `app` directory. [Learn more about i18n](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/internationalization).\n- `basePath` has been removed. The alternative will not be part of `useRouter`. It has not yet been implemented.\n- `asPath` has been removed because the concept of `as` has been removed from the new router.\n- `isReady` has been removed because it is no longer necessary. During [static rendering](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components#static-rendering-default), any component that uses the [`useSearchParams()`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-search-params) hook will skip the prerendering step and instead be rendered on the client at runtime.\n\n[View the `useRouter()` API reference](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-router).\n\n### Step 6: Migrating Data Fetching Methods\n\nThe `pages` directory uses `getServerSideProps` and `getStaticProps` to fetch data for pages. Inside the `app` directory, these previous data fetching functions are replaced with a [simpler API](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching) built on top of `fetch()` and `async` React Server Components.\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/page.tsx\" switcher\nexport default async function Page() {\n  // This request should be cached until manually invalidated.\n  // Similar to `getStaticProps`.\n  // `force-cache` is the default and can be omitted.\n  const staticData = await fetch(`https://...`, { cache: 'force-cache' })\n\n  // This request should be refetched on every request.\n  // Similar to `getServerSideProps`.\n  const dynamicData = await fetch(`https://...`, { cache: 'no-store' })\n\n  // This request should be cached with a lifetime of 10 seconds.\n  // Similar to `getStaticProps` with the `revalidate` option.\n  const revalidatedData = await fetch(`https://...`, {\n    next: { revalidate: 10 },\n  })\n\n  return <div>...</div>\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/page.js\" switcher\nexport default async function Page() {\n  // This request should be cached until manually invalidated.\n  // Similar to `getStaticProps`.\n  // `force-cache` is the default and can be omitted.\n  const staticData = await fetch(`https://...`, { cache: 'force-cache' })\n\n  // This request should be refetched on every request.\n  // Similar to `getServerSideProps`.\n  const dynamicData = await fetch(`https://...`, { cache: 'no-store' })\n\n  // This request should be cached with a lifetime of 10 seconds.\n  // Similar to `getStaticProps` with the `revalidate` option.\n  const revalidatedData = await fetch(`https://...`, {\n    next: { revalidate: 10 },\n  })\n\n  return <div>...</div>\n}\n```\n\n#### Server-side Rendering (`getServerSideProps`)\n\nIn the `pages` directory, `getServerSideProps` is used to fetch data on the server and forward props to the default exported React component in the file. The initial HTML for the page is prerendered from the server, followed by \"hydrating\" the page in the browser (making it interactive).\n\n```jsx filename=\"pages/dashboard.js\"\n// `pages` directory\n\nexport async function getServerSideProps() {\n  const res = await fetch(`https://...`)\n  const projects = await res.json()\n\n  return { props: { projects } }\n}\n\nexport default function Dashboard({ projects }) {\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {projects.map((project) => (\n        <li key={project.id}>{project.name}</li>\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nIn the `app` directory, we can colocate our data fetching inside our React components using [Server Components](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components). This allows us to send less JavaScript to the client, while maintaining the rendered HTML from the server.\n\nBy setting the `cache` option to `no-store`, we can indicate that the fetched data should [never be cached](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/caching-and-revalidating). This is similar to `getServerSideProps` in the `pages` directory.\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/dashboard/page.tsx\" switcher\n// `app` directory\n\n// This function can be named anything\nasync function getProjects() {\n  const res = await fetch(`https://...`, { cache: 'no-store' })\n  const projects = await res.json()\n\n  return projects\n}\n\nexport default async function Dashboard() {\n  const projects = await getProjects()\n\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {projects.map((project) => (\n        <li key={project.id}>{project.name}</li>\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/dashboard/page.js\" switcher\n// `app` directory\n\n// This function can be named anything\nasync function getProjects() {\n  const res = await fetch(`https://...`, { cache: 'no-store' })\n  const projects = await res.json()\n\n  return projects\n}\n\nexport default async function Dashboard() {\n  const projects = await getProjects()\n\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {projects.map((project) => (\n        <li key={project.id}>{project.name}</li>\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n#### Accessing Request Object\n\nIn the `pages` directory, you can retrieve request-based data based on the Node.js HTTP API.\n\nFor example, you can retrieve the `req` object from `getServerSideProps` and use it to retrieve the request's cookies and headers.\n\n```jsx filename=\"pages/index.js\"\n// `pages` directory\n\nexport async function getServerSideProps({ req, query }) {\n  const authHeader = req.getHeaders()['authorization'];\n  const theme = req.cookies['theme'];\n\n  return { props: { ... }}\n}\n\nexport default function Page(props) {\n  return ...\n}\n```\n\nThe `app` directory exposes new read-only functions to retrieve request data:\n\n- [`headers()`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/headers): Based on the Web Headers API, and can be used inside [Server Components](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components) to retrieve request headers.\n- [`cookies()`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/cookies): Based on the Web Cookies API, and can be used inside [Server Components](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components) to retrieve cookies.\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/page.tsx\" switcher\n// `app` directory\nimport { cookies, headers } from 'next/headers'\n\nasync function getData() {\n  const authHeader = headers().get('authorization')\n\n  return '...'\n}\n\nexport default async function Page() {\n  // You can use `cookies()` or `headers()` inside Server Components\n  // directly or in your data fetching function\n  const theme = cookies().get('theme')\n  const data = await getData()\n  return '...'\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/page.js\" switcher\n// `app` directory\nimport { cookies, headers } from 'next/headers'\n\nasync function getData() {\n  const authHeader = headers().get('authorization')\n\n  return '...'\n}\n\nexport default async function Page() {\n  // You can use `cookies()` or `headers()` inside Server Components\n  // directly or in your data fetching function\n  const theme = cookies().get('theme')\n  const data = await getData()\n  return '...'\n}\n```\n\n#### Static Site Generation (`getStaticProps`)\n\nIn the `pages` directory, the `getStaticProps` function is used to pre-render a page at build time. This function can be used to fetch data from an external API or directly from a database, and pass this data down to the entire page as it's being generated during the build.\n\n```jsx filename=\"pages/index.js\"\n// `pages` directory\n\nexport async function getStaticProps() {\n  const res = await fetch(`https://...`)\n  const projects = await res.json()\n\n  return { props: { projects } }\n}\n\nexport default function Index({ projects }) {\n  return projects.map((project) => <div>{project.name}</div>)\n}\n```\n\nIn the `app` directory, data fetching with [`fetch()`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/fetch) will default to `cache: 'force-cache'`, which will cache the request data until manually invalidated. This is similar to `getStaticProps` in the `pages` directory.\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/page.js\"\n// `app` directory\n\n// This function can be named anything\nasync function getProjects() {\n  const res = await fetch(`https://...`)\n  const projects = await res.json()\n\n  return projects\n}\n\nexport default async function Index() {\n  const projects = await getProjects()\n\n  return projects.map((project) => <div>{project.name}</div>)\n}\n```\n\n#### Dynamic paths (`getStaticPaths`)\n\nIn the `pages` directory, the `getStaticPaths` function is used to define the dynamic paths that should be pre-rendered at build time.\n\n```jsx filename=\"pages/posts/[id].js\"\n// `pages` directory\nimport PostLayout from '@/components/post-layout'\n\nexport async function getStaticPaths() {\n  return {\n    paths: [{ params: { id: '1' } }, { params: { id: '2' } }],\n  }\n}\n\nexport async function getStaticProps({ params }) {\n  const res = await fetch(`https://.../posts/${params.id}`)\n  const post = await res.json()\n\n  return { props: { post } }\n}\n\nexport default function Post({ post }) {\n  return <PostLayout post={post} />\n}\n```\n\nIn the `app` directory, `getStaticPaths` is replaced with [`generateStaticParams`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-static-params).\n\n[`generateStaticParams`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-static-params) behaves similarly to `getStaticPaths`, but has a simplified API for returning route parameters and can be used inside [layouts](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/layouts-and-templates). The return shape of `generateStaticParams` is an array of segments instead of an array of nested `param` objects or a string of resolved paths.\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/posts/[id]/page.js\"\n// `app` directory\nimport PostLayout from '@/components/post-layout'\n\nexport async function generateStaticParams() {\n  return [{ id: '1' }, { id: '2' }]\n}\n\nasync function getPost(params) {\n  const res = await fetch(`https://.../posts/${params.id}`)\n  const post = await res.json()\n\n  return post\n}\n\nexport default async function Post({ params }) {\n  const post = await getPost(params)\n\n  return <PostLayout post={post} />\n}\n```\n\nUsing the name `generateStaticParams` is more appropriate than `getStaticPaths` for the new model in the `app` directory. The `get` prefix is replaced with a more descriptive `generate`, which sits better alone now that `getStaticProps` and `getServerSideProps` are no longer necessary. The `Paths` suffix is replaced by `Params`, which is more appropriate for nested routing with multiple dynamic segments.\n\n---\n\n#### Replacing `fallback`\n\nIn the `pages` directory, the `fallback` property returned from `getStaticPaths` is used to define the behavior of a page that isn't pre-rendered at build time. This property can be set to `true` to show a fallback page while the page is being generated, `false` to show a 404 page, or `blocking` to generate the page at request time.\n\n```jsx filename=\"pages/posts/[id].js\"\n// `pages` directory\n\nexport async function getStaticPaths() {\n  return {\n    paths: [],\n    fallback: 'blocking'\n  };\n}\n\nexport async function getStaticProps({ params }) {\n  ...\n}\n\nexport default function Post({ post }) {\n  return ...\n}\n```\n\nIn the `app` directory the [`config.dynamicParams` property](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/route-segment-config#dynamicparams) controls how params outside of [`generateStaticParams`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-static-params) are handled:\n\n- **`true`**: (default) Dynamic segments not included in `generateStaticParams` are generated on demand.\n- **`false`**: Dynamic segments not included in `generateStaticParams` will return a 404.\n\nThis replaces the `fallback: true | false | 'blocking'` option of `getStaticPaths` in the `pages` directory. The `fallback: 'blocking'` option is not included in `dynamicParams` because the difference between `'blocking'` and `true` is negligible with streaming.\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/posts/[id]/page.js\"\n// `app` directory\n\nexport const dynamicParams = true;\n\nexport async function generateStaticParams() {\n  return [...]\n}\n\nasync function getPost(params) {\n  ...\n}\n\nexport default async function Post({ params }) {\n  const post = await getPost(params);\n\n  return ...\n}\n```\n\nWith [`dynamicParams`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/route-segment-config#dynamicparams) set to `true` (the default), when a route segment is requested that hasn't been generated, it will be server-rendered and cached.\n\n#### Incremental Static Regeneration (`getStaticProps` with `revalidate`)\n\nIn the `pages` directory, the `getStaticProps` function allows you to add a `revalidate` field to automatically regenerate a page after a certain amount of time.\n\n```jsx filename=\"pages/index.js\"\n// `pages` directory\n\nexport async function getStaticProps() {\n  const res = await fetch(`https://.../posts`)\n  const posts = await res.json()\n\n  return {\n    props: { posts },\n    revalidate: 60,\n  }\n}\n\nexport default function Index({ posts }) {\n  return (\n    <Layout>\n      <PostList posts={posts} />\n    </Layout>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nIn the `app` directory, data fetching with [`fetch()`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/fetch) can use `revalidate`, which will cache the request for the specified amount of seconds.\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/page.js\"\n// `app` directory\n\nasync function getPosts() {\n  const res = await fetch(`https://.../posts`, { next: { revalidate: 60 } })\n  const data = await res.json()\n\n  return data.posts\n}\n\nexport default async function PostList() {\n  const posts = await getPosts()\n\n  return posts.map((post) => <div>{post.name}</div>)\n}\n```\n\n#### API Routes\n\nAPI Routes continue to work in the `pages/api` directory without any changes. However, they have been replaced by [Route Handlers](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-handlers) in the `app` directory.\n\nRoute Handlers allow you to create custom request handlers for a given route using the Web [Request](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Request) and [Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Response) APIs.\n\n```ts filename=\"app/api/route.ts\" switcher\nexport async function GET(request: Request) {}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"app/api/route.js\" switcher\nexport async function GET(request) {}\n```\n\n> **Good to know**: If you previously used API routes to call an external API from the client, you can now use [Server Components](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components) instead to securely fetch data. Learn more about [data fetching](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/caching-and-revalidating).\n\n### Step 7: Styling\n\nIn the `pages` directory, global stylesheets are restricted to only `pages/_app.js`. With the `app` directory, this restriction has been lifted. Global styles can be added to any layout, page, or component.\n\n- [CSS Modules](/docs/app/building-your-application/styling/css-modules)\n- [Tailwind CSS](/docs/app/building-your-application/styling/tailwind-css)\n- [Global Styles](/docs/app/building-your-application/styling/css-modules#global-styles)\n- [CSS-in-JS](/docs/app/building-your-application/styling/css-in-js)\n- [External Stylesheets](/docs/app/building-your-application/styling/css-modules#external-stylesheets)\n- [Sass](/docs/app/building-your-application/styling/sass)\n\n#### Tailwind CSS\n\nIf you're using Tailwind CSS, you'll need to add the `app` directory to your `tailwind.config.js` file:\n\n```js filename=\"tailwind.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  content: [\n    './app/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}', // <-- Add this line\n    './pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}',\n    './components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}',\n  ],\n}\n```\n\nYou'll also need to import your global styles in your `app/layout.js` file:\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/layout.js\"\nimport '../styles/globals.css'\n\nexport default function RootLayout({ children }) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <body>{children}</body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nLearn more about [styling with Tailwind CSS](/docs/app/building-your-application/styling/tailwind-css)\n\n## Codemods\n\nNext.js provides Codemod transformations to help upgrade your codebase when a feature is deprecated. See [Codemods](/docs/app/building-your-application/upgrading/codemods) for more information.\n"},{"path":"docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/11-upgrading/05-from-vite.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/11-upgrading/05-from-vite.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/upgrading/from-vite","sha":"4bbb18c633c7a9a9ad2bd4596792e0a8f902eec6","size":22997,"content":"---\ntitle: Migrating from Vite\ndescription: Learn how to migrate your existing React application from Vite to Next.js.\n---\n\nThis guide will help you migrate an existing Vite application to Next.js.\n\n## Why Switch?\n\nThere are several reasons why you might want to switch from Vite to Next.js:\n\n### Slow initial page loading time\n\nIf you have built your application with the [default Vite plugin for React](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/tree/main/packages/plugin-react), your application is a purely client-side application. Client-side only applications, also known as single-page applications (SPAs), often experience slow initial page loading time. This happens due to a couple of reasons:\n\n1. The browser needs to wait for the React code and your entire application bundle to download and run before your code is able to send requests to load some data.\n2. Your application code grows with every new feature and extra dependency you add.\n\n### No automatic code splitting\n\nThe previous issue of slow loading times can be somewhat managed with code splitting. However, if you try to do code splitting manually, you'll often make performance worse. It's easy to inadvertently introduce network waterfalls when code-splitting manually. Next.js provides automatic code splitting built into its router.\n\n### Network waterfalls\n\nA common cause of poor performance occurs when applications make sequential client-server requests to fetch data. One common pattern for data fetching in an SPA is to initially render a placeholder, and then fetch data after the component has mounted. Unfortunately, this means that a child component that fetches data can't start fetching until the parent component has finished loading its own data.\n\nWhile fetching data on the client is supported with Next.js, it also gives you the option to shift data fetching to the server, which can eliminate client-server waterfalls.\n\n### Fast and intentional loading states\n\nWith built-in support for [streaming through React Suspense](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/loading-ui-and-streaming#streaming-with-suspense), you can be more intentional about which parts of your UI you want to load first and in what order without introducing network waterfalls.\n\nThis enables you to build pages that are faster to load and eliminate [layout shifts](https://vercel.com/blog/how-core-web-vitals-affect-seo).\n\n### Choose the data fetching strategy\n\nDepending on your needs, Next.js allows you to choose your data fetching strategy on a page and component basis. You can decide to fetch at build time, at request time on the server, or on the client. For example, you can fetch data from your CMS and render your blog posts at build time, which can then be efficiently cached on a CDN.\n\n### Middleware\n\n[Next.js Middleware](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware) allows you to run code on the server before a request is completed. This is especially useful to avoid having a flash of unauthenticated content when the user visits an authenticated-only page by redirecting the user to a login page. The middleware is also useful for experimentation and [internationalization](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/internationalization).\n\n### Built-in Optimizations\n\n[Images](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/images), [fonts](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts), and [third-party scripts](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/scripts) often have significant impact on an application's performance. Next.js comes with built-in components that automatically optimize those for you.\n\n## Migration Steps\n\nOur goal with this migration is to get a working Next.js application as quickly as possible, so that\nyou can then adopt Next.js features incrementally. To begin with, we'll keep it as a purely\nclient-side application (SPA) without migrating your existing router. This helps minimize the\nchances of encountering issues during the migration process and reduces merge conflicts.\n\n### Step 1: Install the Next.js Dependency\n\nThe first thing you need to do is to install `next` as a dependency:\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nnpm install next@latest\n```\n\n### Step 2: Create the Next.js Configuration File\n\nCreate a `next.config.mjs` at the root of your project. This file will hold your\n[Next.js configuration options](/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js).\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.mjs\"\n/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */\nconst nextConfig = {\n  output: 'export', // Outputs a Single-Page Application (SPA).\n  distDir: './dist', // Changes the build output directory to `./dist/`.\n}\n\nexport default nextConfig\n```\n\n> **Good to know:** You can use either `.js` or `.mjs` for your Next.js configuration file.\n\n### Step 3: Update TypeScript Configuration\n\nIf you're using TypeScript, you need to update your `tsconfig.json` file with the following changes\nto make it compatible with Next.js. If you're not using TypeScript, you can skip this step.\n\n1. Remove the [project reference](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#references) to `tsconfig.node.json`\n2. Add `./dist/types/**/*.ts` and `./next-env.d.ts` to the [`include` array](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#include)\n3. Add `./node_modules` to the [`exclude` array](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#exclude)\n4. Add `{ \"name\": \"next\" }` to the [`plugins` array in `compilerOptions`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#plugins): `\"plugins\": [{ \"name\": \"next\" }]`\n5. Set [`esModuleInterop`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#esModuleInterop) to `true`: `\"esModuleInterop\": true`\n6. Set [`jsx`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#jsx) to `preserve`: `\"jsx\": \"preserve\"`\n7. Set [`allowJs`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#allowJs) to `true`: `\"allowJs\": true`\n8. Set [`forceConsistentCasingInFileNames`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#forceConsistentCasingInFileNames) to `true`: `\"forceConsistentCasingInFileNames\": true`\n9. Set [`incremental`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#incremental) to `true`: `\"incremental\": true`\n\nHere's an example of a working `tsconfig.json` with those changes:\n\n```json filename=\"tsconfig.json\"\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"target\": \"ES2020\",\n    \"useDefineForClassFields\": true,\n    \"lib\": [\"ES2020\", \"DOM\", \"DOM.Iterable\"],\n    \"module\": \"ESNext\",\n    \"esModuleInterop\": true,\n    \"skipLibCheck\": true,\n    \"moduleResolution\": \"bundler\",\n    \"allowImportingTsExtensions\": true,\n    \"resolveJsonModule\": true,\n    \"isolatedModules\": true,\n    \"noEmit\": true,\n    \"jsx\": \"preserve\",\n    \"strict\": true,\n    \"noUnusedLocals\": true,\n    \"noUnusedParameters\": true,\n    \"noFallthroughCasesInSwitch\": true,\n    \"allowJs\": true,\n    \"forceConsistentCasingInFileNames\": true,\n    \"incremental\": true,\n    \"plugins\": [{ \"name\": \"next\" }]\n  },\n  \"include\": [\"./src\", \"./dist/types/**/*.ts\", \"./next-env.d.ts\"],\n  \"exclude\": [\"./node_modules\"]\n}\n```\n\nYou can find more information about configuring TypeScript on the\n[Next.js docs](/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/typescript#typescript-plugin).\n\n### Step 4: Create the Root Layout\n\nA Next.js [App Router](/docs/app) application must include a\n[root layout](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/layouts-and-templates#root-layout-required)\nfile, which is a [React Server Component](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components)\nthat will wrap all pages in your application. This file is defined at the top level of the `app`\ndirectory.\n\nThe closest equivalent to the root layout file in a Vite application is the\n[`index.html` file](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#index-html-and-project-root), which contains your\n`<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.\n\nIn this step, you'll convert your `index.html` file into a root layout file:\n\n1. Create a new `app` directory in your `src` directory.\n2. Create a new `layout.tsx` file inside that `app` directory:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/layout.tsx\" switcher\nexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return null\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/layout.js\" switcher\nexport default function RootLayout({ children }) {\n  return null\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know**: `.js`, `.jsx`, or `.tsx` extensions can be used for Layout files.\n\n3. Copy the content of your `index.html` file into the previously created `<RootLayout>` component while\n   replacing the `body.div#root` and `body.script` tags with `<div id=\"root\">{children}</div>`:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/layout.tsx\" switcher\nexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <head>\n        <meta charset=\"UTF-8\" />\n        <link rel=\"icon\" type=\"image/svg+xml\" href=\"/icon.svg\" />\n        <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\" />\n        <title>My App</title>\n        <meta name=\"description\" content=\"My App is a...\" />\n      </head>\n      <body>\n        <div id=\"root\">{children}</div>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/layout.js\" switcher\nexport default function RootLayout({ children }) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <head>\n        <meta charset=\"UTF-8\" />\n        <link rel=\"icon\" type=\"image/svg+xml\" href=\"/icon.svg\" />\n        <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\" />\n        <title>My App</title>\n        <meta name=\"description\" content=\"My App is a...\" />\n      </head>\n      <body>\n        <div id=\"root\">{children}</div>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n4. Next.js already includes by default the\n   [meta charset](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta#charset) and\n   [meta viewport](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Viewport_meta_tag) tags, so you\n   can safely remove those from your `<head>`:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/layout.tsx\" switcher\nexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <head>\n        <link rel=\"icon\" type=\"image/svg+xml\" href=\"/icon.svg\" />\n        <title>My App</title>\n        <meta name=\"description\" content=\"My App is a...\" />\n      </head>\n      <body>\n        <div id=\"root\">{children}</div>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/layout.js\" switcher\nexport default function RootLayout({ children }) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <head>\n        <link rel=\"icon\" type=\"image/svg+xml\" href=\"/icon.svg\" />\n        <title>My App</title>\n        <meta name=\"description\" content=\"My App is a...\" />\n      </head>\n      <body>\n        <div id=\"root\">{children}</div>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n5. Any [metadata files](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/metadata#file-based-metadata)\n   such as `favicon.ico`, `icon.png`, `robots.txt` are automatically added to the application\n   `<head>` tag as long as you have them placed into the top level of the `app` directory. After\n   moving\n   [all supported files](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/metadata#file-based-metadata)\n   into the `app` directory you can safely delete their `<link>` tags:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/layout.tsx\" switcher\nexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <head>\n        <title>My App</title>\n        <meta name=\"description\" content=\"My App is a...\" />\n      </head>\n      <body>\n        <div id=\"root\">{children}</div>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/layout.js\" switcher\nexport default function RootLayout({ children }) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <head>\n        <title>My App</title>\n        <meta name=\"description\" content=\"My App is a...\" />\n      </head>\n      <body>\n        <div id=\"root\">{children}</div>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n6. Finally, Next.js can manage your last `<head>` tags with the\n   [Metadata API](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/metadata). Move your final metadata\n   info into an exported\n   [`metadata` object](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-metadata#metadata-object):\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/layout.tsx\" switcher\nimport type { Metadata } from 'next'\n\nexport const metadata: Metadata = {\n  title: 'My App',\n  description: 'My App is a...',\n}\n\nexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <body>\n        <div id=\"root\">{children}</div>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/layout.js\" switcher\nexport const metadata = {\n  title: 'My App',\n  description: 'My App is a...',\n}\n\nexport default function RootLayout({ children }) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <body>\n        <div id=\"root\">{children}</div>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nWith the above changes, you shifted from declaring everything in your `index.html` to using Next.js'\nconvention-based approach built into the framework\n([Metadata API](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/metadata)). This approach enables you\nto more easily improve your SEO and web shareability of your pages.\n\n### Step 5: Create the Entrypoint Page\n\nOn Next.js you declare an entrypoint for your application by creating a `page.tsx` file. The\nclosest equivalent of this file on Vite is your `main.tsx` file. In this step, you’ll set up the\nentrypoint of your application.\n\n1. **Create a `[[...slug]]` directory in your `app` directory.**\n\nSince in this guide we're aiming first to set up our Next.js as an SPA (Single Page Application),\nyou need your page entrypoint to catch all possible routes of your application. For that, create a\nnew `[[...slug]]` directory in your `app` directory.\n\nThis directory is what is called an\n[optional catch-all route segment](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes#optional-catch-all-segments).\nNext.js uses a file-system based router where\n[directories are used to define routes](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/defining-routes#creating-routes).\nThis special directory will make sure that all routes of your application will be directed to its\ncontaining `page.tsx` file.\n\n2. **Create a new `page.tsx` file inside the `app/[[...slug]]` directory with the following content:**\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/[[...slug]]/page.tsx\" switcher\nimport '../../index.css'\n\nexport function generateStaticParams() {\n  return [{ slug: [''] }]\n}\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return '...' // We'll update this\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/[[...slug]]/page.js\" switcher\nimport '../../index.css'\n\nexport function generateStaticParams() {\n  return [{ slug: [''] }]\n}\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return '...' // We'll update this\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know**: `.js`, `.jsx`, or `.tsx` extensions can be used for Page files.\n\nThis file is a [Server Component](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components). When you run `next build`, the file is prerendered into a static asset. It does _not_ require any dynamic code.\n\nThis file imports our global CSS and tells [`generateStaticParams`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-static-params) we are only going to generate one route, the index route at `/`.\n\nNow, let's move the rest of our Vite application which will run client-only.\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/[[...slug]]/client.tsx\" switcher\n'use client'\n\nimport React from 'react'\nimport dynamic from 'next/dynamic'\n\nconst App = dynamic(() => import('../../App'), { ssr: false })\n\nexport function ClientOnly() {\n  return <App />\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/[[...slug]]/client.js\" switcher\n'use client'\n\nimport React from 'react'\nimport dynamic from 'next/dynamic'\n\nconst App = dynamic(() => import('../../App'), { ssr: false })\n\nexport function ClientOnly() {\n  return <App />\n}\n```\n\nThis file is a [Client Component](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/client-components), defined by the `'use client'`\ndirective. Client Components are still [prerendered to HTML](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/client-components#how-are-client-components-rendered) on the server before being sent to the client.\n\nSince we want a client-only application to start, we can configure Next.js to disable prerendering from the `App` component down.\n\n```tsx\nconst App = dynamic(() => import('../../App'), { ssr: false })\n```\n\nNow, update your entrypoint page to use the new component:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/[[...slug]]/page.tsx\" switcher\nimport '../../index.css'\nimport { ClientOnly } from './client'\n\nexport function generateStaticParams() {\n  return [{ slug: [''] }]\n}\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return <ClientOnly />\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/[[...slug]]/page.js\" switcher\nimport '../../index.css'\nimport { ClientOnly } from './client'\n\nexport function generateStaticParams() {\n  return [{ slug: [''] }]\n}\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return <ClientOnly />\n}\n```\n\n### Step 6: Update Static Image Imports\n\nNext.js handles static image imports slightly different from Vite. With Vite, importing an image\nfile will return its public URL as a string:\n\n```tsx filename=\"App.tsx\"\nimport image from './img.png' // `image` will be '/assets/img.2d8efhg.png' in production\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return <img src={image} />\n}\n```\n\nWith Next.js, static image imports return an object. The object can then be used directly with the\nNext.js [`<Image>` component](/docs/app/api-reference/components/image), or you can use the object's\n`src` property with your existing `<img>` tag.\n\nThe `<Image>` component has the added benefits of\n[automatic image optimization](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/images). The `<Image>`\ncomponent automatically sets the `width` and `height` attributes of the resulting `<img>` based on\nthe image's dimensions. This prevents layout shifts when the image loads. However, this can cause\nissues if your app contains images with only one of their dimensions being styled without the other\nstyled to `auto`. When not styled to `auto`, the dimension will default to the `<img>` dimension\nattribute's value, which can cause the image to appear distorted.\n\nKeeping the `<img>` tag will reduce the amount of changes in your application and prevent the above\nissues. You can then optionally later migrate to the `<Image>` component to take advantage of optimizing images by [configuring a loader](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/images#loaders), or moving to the default Next.js server which has automatic image optimization.\n\n1. **Convert absolute import paths for images imported from `/public` into relative imports:**\n\n```tsx\n// Before\nimport logo from '/logo.png'\n\n// After\nimport logo from '../public/logo.png'\n```\n\n2. **Pass the image `src` property instead of the whole image object to your `<img>` tag:**\n\n```tsx\n// Before\n<img src={logo} />\n\n// After\n<img src={logo.src} />\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can reference the public URL for the image asset based on the filename. For example, `public/logo.png` will serve the image at `/logo.png` for your application, which would be the `src` value.\n\n> **Warning:** If you're using TypeScript, you might encounter type errors when accessing the `src`\n> property. You can safely ignore those for now. They will be fixed by the end of this guide.\n\n### Step 7: Migrate the Environment Variables\n\nNext.js has support for `.env`\n[environment variables](/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/environment-variables)\nsimilar to Vite. The main difference is the prefix used to expose environment variables on the\nclient-side.\n\n- Change all environment variables with the `VITE_` prefix to `NEXT_PUBLIC_`.\n\nVite exposes a few built-in environment variables on the special `import.meta.env` object which\naren’t supported by Next.js. You need to update their usage as follows:\n\n- `import.meta.env.MODE` ⇒ `process.env.NODE_ENV`\n- `import.meta.env.PROD` ⇒ `process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'`\n- `import.meta.env.DEV` ⇒ `process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'`\n- `import.meta.env.SSR` ⇒ `typeof window !== 'undefined'`\n\nNext.js also doesn't provide a built-in `BASE_URL` environment variable. However, you can still\nconfigure one, if you need it:\n\n1. **Add the following to your `.env` file:**\n\n```bash filename=\".env\"\n# ...\nNEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH=\"/some-base-path\"\n```\n\n2. **Set [`basePath`](/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/basePath) to `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH` in your `next.config.mjs` file:**\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.mjs\"\n/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */\nconst nextConfig = {\n  output: 'export', // Outputs a Single-Page Application (SPA).\n  distDir: './dist', // Changes the build output directory to `./dist/`.\n  basePath: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH, // Sets the base path to `/some-base-path`.\n}\n\nexport default nextConfig\n```\n\n3. **Update `import.meta.env.BASE_URL` usages to `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH`**\n\n### Step 8: Update Scripts in `package.json`\n\nYou should now be able to run your application to test if you successfully migrated to Next.js. But\nbefore that, you need to update your `scripts` in your `package.json` with Next.js related commands,\nand add `.next` and `next-env.d.ts` to your `.gitignore`:\n\n```json filename=\"package.json\"\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"dev\": \"next dev\",\n    \"build\": \"next build\",\n    \"start\": \"next start\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```txt filename=\".gitignore\"\n# ...\n.next\nnext-env.d.ts\ndist\n```\n\nNow run `npm run dev`, and open [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000). You should see your application now running on Next.js.\n\n> **Example:** Check out [this pull request](https://github.com/inngest/vite-to-nextjs/pull/1) for a\n> working example of a Vite application migrated to Next.js.\n\n### Step 9: Clean Up\n\nYou can now clean up your codebase from Vite related artifacts:\n\n- Delete `main.tsx`\n- Delete `index.html`\n- Delete `vite-env.d.ts`\n- Delete `tsconfig.node.json`\n- Delete `vite.config.ts`\n- Uninstall Vite dependencies\n\n## Next Steps\n\nIf everything went according to plan, you now have a functioning Next.js application running as a\nsingle-page application. However, you aren't yet taking advantage of most of Next.js' benefits, but\nyou can now start making incremental changes to reap all the benefits. Here's what you might want to\ndo next:\n\n- Migrate from React Router to the [Next.js App Router](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing) to get:\n  - Automatic code splitting\n  - [Streaming Server-Rendering](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/loading-ui-and-streaming)\n  - [React Server Components](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components)\n- [Optimize images with the `<Image>` component](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/images)\n- [Optimize fonts with `next/font`](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts)\n- [Optimize third-party scripts with the `<Script>` component](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/scripts)\n- [Update your ESLint configuration to support Next.js rules](/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/eslint)\n"},{"path":"docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/11-upgrading/05-from-create-react-app.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/11-upgrading/05-from-create-react-app.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/upgrading/from-create-react-app","sha":"ccd8d8ac35322aa7fa3b6cbc54ab725c5f5ee90d","size":20590,"content":"---\ntitle: Migrating from Create React App\ndescription: Learn how to migrate your existing React application from Create React App to Next.js.\n---\n\nThis guide will help you migrate an existing Create React App site to Next.js.\n\n## Why Switch?\n\nThere are several reasons why you might want to switch from Create React App to Next.js:\n\n### Slow initial page loading time\n\nCreate React App uses purely client-side React. Client-side only applications, also known as single-page applications (SPAs), often experience slow initial page loading time. This happens due to a couple of reasons:\n\n1. The browser needs to wait for the React code and your entire application bundle to download and run before your code is able to send requests to load data.\n2. Your application code grows with every new feature and dependency you add.\n\n### No automatic code splitting\n\nThe previous issue of slow loading times can be somewhat managed with code splitting. However, if you try to do code splitting manually, you'll often make performance worse. It's easy to inadvertently introduce network waterfalls when code-splitting manually. Next.js provides automatic code splitting built into its router.\n\n### Network waterfalls\n\nA common cause of poor performance occurs when applications make sequential client-server requests to fetch data. One common pattern for data fetching in an SPA is to initially render a placeholder, and then fetch data after the component has mounted. Unfortunately, this means that a child component that fetches data can't start fetching until the parent component has finished loading its own data.\n\nWhile fetching data on the client is supported with Next.js, it also gives you the option to shift data fetching to the server, which can eliminate client-server waterfalls.\n\n### Fast and intentional loading states\n\nWith built-in support for [streaming through React Suspense](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/loading-ui-and-streaming#streaming-with-suspense), you can be more intentional about which parts of your UI you want to load first and in what order without introducing network waterfalls.\n\nThis enables you to build pages that are faster to load and eliminate [layout shifts](https://vercel.com/blog/how-core-web-vitals-affect-seo).\n\n### Choose the data fetching strategy\n\nDepending on your needs, Next.js allows you to choose your data fetching strategy on a page and component basis. You can decide to fetch at build time, at request time on the server, or on the client. For example, you can fetch data from your CMS and render your blog posts at build time, which can then be efficiently cached on a CDN.\n\n### Middleware\n\n[Next.js Middleware](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware) allows you to run code on the server before a request is completed. This is especially useful to avoid having a flash of unauthenticated content when the user visits an authenticated-only page by redirecting the user to a login page. The middleware is also useful for experimentation and [internationalization](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/internationalization).\n\n### Built-in Optimizations\n\n[Images](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/images), [fonts](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts), and [third-party scripts](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/scripts) often have significant impact on an application's performance. Next.js comes with built-in components that automatically optimize those for you.\n\n## Migration Steps\n\nOur goal with this migration is to get a working Next.js application as quickly as possible, so that you can then adopt Next.js features incrementally. To begin with, we'll keep it as a purely client-side application (SPA) without migrating your existing router. This helps minimize the chances of encountering issues during the migration process and reduces merge conflicts.\n\n### Step 1: Install the Next.js Dependency\n\nThe first thing you need to do is to install `next` as a dependency:\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nnpm install next@latest\n```\n\n### Step 2: Create the Next.js Configuration File\n\nCreate a `next.config.mjs` at the root of your project. This file will hold your [Next.js configuration options](/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js).\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.mjs\"\n/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */\nconst nextConfig = {\n  output: 'export', // Outputs a Single-Page Application (SPA).\n  distDir: './build', // Changes the build output directory to `./dist`.\n}\n\nexport default nextConfig\n```\n\n### Step 3: Create the Root Layout\n\nA Next.js [App Router](/docs/app) application must include a [root layout](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/layouts-and-templates#root-layout-required) file, which is a [React Server Component](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components) that will wrap all pages in your application. This file is defined at the top level of the `app` directory.\n\nThe closest equivalent to the root layout file in a CRA application is the `index.html` file, which contains your `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.\n\nIn this step, you'll convert your `index.html` file into a root layout file:\n\n1. Create a new `app` directory in your `src` directory.\n2. Create a new `layout.tsx` file inside that `app` directory:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/layout.tsx\" switcher\nexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return null\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/layout.js\" switcher\nexport default function RootLayout({ children }) {\n  return null\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know**: `.js`, `.jsx`, or `.tsx` extensions can be used for Layout files.\n\nCopy the content of your `index.html` file into the previously created `<RootLayout>` component while replacing the `body.div#root` and `body.noscript` tags with `<div id=\"root\">{children}</div>`:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/layout.tsx\" switcher\nexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <head>\n        <meta charSet=\"UTF-8\" />\n        <link rel=\"icon\" href=\"%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico\" />\n        <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" />\n        <title>React App</title>\n        <meta name=\"description\" content=\"Web site created...\" />\n      </head>\n      <body>\n        <div id=\"root\">{children}</div>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/layout.js\" switcher\nexport default function RootLayout({ children }) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <head>\n        <meta charset=\"UTF-8\" />\n        <link rel=\"icon\" href=\"%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico\" />\n        <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" />\n        <title>React App</title>\n        <meta name=\"description\" content=\"Web site created...\" />\n      </head>\n      <body>\n        <div id=\"root\">{children}</div>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know**: We'll ignore the [manifest file](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/metadata), additional iconography other than the favicon, and [testing configuration](/docs/app/building-your-application/testing), but if these are requirements, Next.js also supports these options.\n\n### Step 4: Metadata\n\nNext.js already includes by default the [meta charset](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta#charset) and [meta viewport](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Viewport_meta_tag) tags, so you can safely remove those from your `<head>`:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/layout.tsx\" switcher\nexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <head>\n        <link rel=\"icon\" href=\"%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico\" />\n        <title>React App</title>\n        <meta name=\"description\" content=\"Web site created...\" />\n      </head>\n      <body>\n        <div id=\"root\">{children}</div>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/layout.js\" switcher\nexport default function RootLayout({ children }) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <head>\n        <link rel=\"icon\" href=\"%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico\" />\n        <title>React App</title>\n        <meta name=\"description\" content=\"Web site created...\" />\n      </head>\n      <body>\n        <div id=\"root\">{children}</div>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nAny [metadata files](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/metadata#file-based-metadata) such as `favicon.ico`, `icon.png`, `robots.txt` are automatically added to the application `<head>` tag as long as you have them placed into the top level of the `app` directory. After moving [all supported files](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/metadata#file-based-metadata) into the `app` directory you can safely delete their `<link>` tags:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/layout.tsx\" switcher\nexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <head>\n        <title>React App</title>\n        <meta name=\"description\" content=\"Web site created...\" />\n      </head>\n      <body>\n        <div id=\"root\">{children}</div>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/layout.js\" switcher\nexport default function RootLayout({ children }) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <head>\n        <title>React App</title>\n        <meta name=\"description\" content=\"Web site created...\" />\n      </head>\n      <body>\n        <div id=\"root\">{children}</div>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nFinally, Next.js can manage your last `<head>` tags with the [Metadata API](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/metadata). Move your final metadata info into an exported [`metadata` object](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-metadata#metadata-object):\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/layout.tsx\" switcher\nimport type { Metadata } from 'next'\n\nexport const metadata: Metadata = {\n  title: 'React App',\n  description: 'Web site created with Next.js.',\n}\n\nexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <body>\n        <div id=\"root\">{children}</div>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/layout.js\" switcher\nexport const metadata = {\n  title: 'React App',\n  description: 'Web site created with Next.js.',\n}\n\nexport default function RootLayout({ children }) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <body>\n        <div id=\"root\">{children}</div>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nWith the above changes, you shifted from declaring everything in your `index.html` to using Next.js' convention-based approach built into the framework ([Metadata API](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/metadata)). This approach enables you to more easily improve your SEO and web shareability of your pages.\n\n### Step 5: Styles\n\nLike Create React App, Next.js has built-in support for [CSS Modules](/docs/app/building-your-application/styling/css-modules).\n\nIf you're using a global CSS file, import it into your `app/layout.tsx` file:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/layout.tsx\" switcher\nimport '../index.css'\n\n// ...\n```\n\nIf you're using Tailwind, you'll need to install `postcss` and `autoprefixer`:\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nnpm install postcss autoprefixer\n```\n\nThen, create a `postcss.config.js` file at the root of your project:\n\n```js filename=\"postcss.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  plugins: {\n    tailwindcss: {},\n    autoprefixer: {},\n  },\n}\n```\n\n### Step 6: Create the Entrypoint Page\n\nOn Next.js you declare an entrypoint for your application by creating a `page.tsx` file. The closest equivalent of this file on CRA is your `src/index.tsx` file. In this step, you’ll set up the entry point of your application.\n\n**Create a `[[...slug]]` directory in your `app` directory.**\n\nSince this guide is aiming to first set up our Next.js as an SPA (Single Page Application), you need your page entry point to catch all possible routes of your application. For that, create a new `[[...slug]]` directory in your `app` directory.\n\nThis directory is what is called an [optional catch-all route segment](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes#optional-catch-all-segments). Next.js uses a file-system based router where [directories are used to define routes](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/defining-routes#creating-routes). This special directory will make sure that all routes of your application will be directed to its containing `page.tsx` file.\n\n**Create a new `page.tsx` file inside the `app/[[...slug]]` directory with the following content:**\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/[[...slug]]/page.tsx\" switcher\nexport function generateStaticParams() {\n  return [{ slug: [''] }]\n}\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return '...' // We'll update this\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/[[...slug]]/page.js\" switcher\nexport function generateStaticParams() {\n  return [{ slug: [''] }]\n}\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return '...' // We'll update this\n}\n```\n\nThis file is a [Server Component](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components). When you run `next build`, the file is prerendered into a static asset. It does _not_ require any dynamic code.\n\nThis file imports our global CSS and tells [`generateStaticParams`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-static-params) we are only going to generate one route, the index route at `/`.\n\nNow, let's move the rest of our CRA application which will run client-only.\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/[[...slug]]/client.tsx\" switcher\n'use client'\n\nimport dynamic from 'next/dynamic'\n\nconst App = dynamic(() => import('../../App'), { ssr: false })\n\nexport function ClientOnly() {\n  return <App />\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/[[...slug]]/client.js\" switcher\n'use client'\n\nimport dynamic from 'next/dynamic'\n\nconst App = dynamic(() => import('../../App'), { ssr: false })\n\nexport function ClientOnly() {\n  return <App />\n}\n```\n\nThis file is a [Client Component](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/client-components), defined by the `'use client'` directive. Client Components are still [prerendered to HTML](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/client-components#how-are-client-components-rendered) on the server before being sent to the client.\n\nSince we want a client-only application to start, we can configure Next.js to disable prerendering from the `App` component down.\n\n```tsx\nconst App = dynamic(() => import('../../App'), { ssr: false })\n```\n\nNow, update your entrypoint page to use the new component:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/[[...slug]]/page.tsx\" switcher\nimport { ClientOnly } from './client'\n\nexport function generateStaticParams() {\n  return [{ slug: [''] }]\n}\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return <ClientOnly />\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/[[...slug]]/page.js\" switcher\nimport { ClientOnly } from './client'\n\nexport function generateStaticParams() {\n  return [{ slug: [''] }]\n}\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return <ClientOnly />\n}\n```\n\n### Step 7: Update Static Image Imports\n\nNext.js handles static image imports slightly different from CRA. With CRA, importing an image file will return its public URL as a string:\n\n```tsx filename=\"App.tsx\"\nimport image from './img.png'\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return <img src={image} />\n}\n```\n\nWith Next.js, static image imports return an object. The object can then be used directly with the Next.js [`<Image>` component](/docs/app/api-reference/components/image), or you can use the object's `src` property with your existing `<img>` tag.\n\nThe `<Image>` component has the added benefits of [automatic image optimization](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/images). The `<Image>` component automatically sets the `width` and `height` attributes of the resulting `<img>` based on the image's dimensions. This prevents layout shifts when the image loads. However, this can cause issues if your app contains images with only one of their dimensions being styled without the other styled to `auto`. When not styled to `auto`, the dimension will default to the `<img>` dimension attribute's value, which can cause the image to appear distorted.\n\nKeeping the `<img>` tag will reduce the amount of changes in your application and prevent the above issues. You can then optionally later migrate to the `<Image>` component to take advantage of optimizing images by [configuring a loader](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/images#loaders), or moving to the default Next.js server which has automatic image optimization.\n\n**Convert absolute import paths for images imported from `/public` into relative imports:**\n\n```tsx\n// Before\nimport logo from '/logo.png'\n\n// After\nimport logo from '../public/logo.png'\n```\n\n**Pass the image `src` property instead of the whole image object to your `<img>` tag:**\n\n```tsx\n// Before\n<img src={logo} />\n\n// After\n<img src={logo.src} />\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can reference the public URL for the image asset based on the filename. For example, `public/logo.png` will serve the image at `/logo.png` for your application, which would be the `src` value.\n\n> **Warning:** If you're using TypeScript, you might encounter type errors when accessing the `src` property. To fix them, you need to add `next-env.d.ts` to the [`include` array](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#include) of your `tsconfig.json` file. Next.js will automatically generate this file when you run your application on step 9.\n\n### Step 8: Migrate the Environment Variables\n\nNext.js has support for `.env` [environment variables](/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/environment-variables) similar to CRA.\n\nThe main difference is the prefix used to expose environment variables on the client-side. Change all environment variables with the `REACT_APP_` prefix to `NEXT_PUBLIC_`.\n\n### Step 9: Update Scripts in `package.json`\n\nYou should now be able to run your application to test if you successfully migrated to Next.js. But before that, you need to update your `scripts` in your `package.json` with Next.js related commands, and add `.next`, and `next-env.d.ts` to your `.gitignore` file:\n\n```json filename=\"package.json\"\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"dev\": \"next dev\",\n    \"build\": \"next build\",\n    \"start\": \"npx serve@latest ./build\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```txt filename=\".gitignore\"\n# ...\n.next\nnext-env.d.ts\n```\n\nNow run `npm run dev`, and open [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000). You should see your application now running on Next.js.\n\n### Step 10: Clean Up\n\nYou can now clean up your codebase from Create React App related artifacts:\n\n- Delete `public/index.html`\n- Delete `src/index.tsx`\n- Delete `src/react-app-env.d.ts`\n- Delete `reportWebVitals` setup\n- Uninstall CRA dependencies (`react-scripts`)\n\n## Bundler Compatibility\n\nCreate React App and Next.js both default to using webpack for bundling.\n\nWhen migrating your CRA application to Next.js, you might have a custom webpack configuration you're looking to migrate. Next.js supports providing a [custom webpack configuration](/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/webpack).\n\nFurther, Next.js has support for [Turbopack](/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/turbo) through `next dev --turbo` to improve your local dev performance. Turbopack supports some [webpack loaders](/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/turbo) as well for compatibility and incremental adoption.\n\n## Next Steps\n\nIf everything went according to plan, you now have a functioning Next.js application running as a single-page application. However, you aren't yet taking advantage of most of Next.js' benefits, but you can now start making incremental changes to reap all the benefits. Here's what you might want to do next:\n\n- Migrate from React Router to the [Next.js App Router](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing) to get:\n  - Automatic code splitting\n  - [Streaming Server-Rendering](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/loading-ui-and-streaming)\n  - [React Server Components](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components)\n- [Optimize images with the `<Image>` component](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/images)\n- [Optimize fonts with `next/font`](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts)\n- [Optimize third-party scripts with the `<Script>` component](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/scripts)\n- [Update your ESLint configuration to support Next.js rules](/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/eslint)\n\n> **Good to know:** Using a static export [does not currently support](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/54393) using the `useParams` hook.\n"},{"path":"docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/05-styling/index.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/05-styling/index.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/styling","sha":"20cf28d2676b704d06c01616e7b9b36f982bcad0","size":1120,"content":"---\ntitle: Styling\ndescription: Learn the different ways you can style your Next.js application.\n---\n\n{/* The content of this doc is shared between the app and pages router.

files:\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nnpm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer\nnpx tailwindcss init -p\n```\n\n## Configuring Tailwind\n\nInside `tailwind.config.js`, add paths to the files that will use Tailwind CSS class names:\n\n```js filename=\"tailwind.config.js\"\n/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */\nmodule.exports = {\n  content: [\n    './app/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}', // Note the addition of the `app` directory.\n    './pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}',\n    './components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}',\n\n    // Or if using `src` directory:\n

[Tailwind CSS directives](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/functions-and-directives#directives) that Tailwind will use to inject its generated styles to a [Global Stylesheet](/docs/app/building-your-application/styling/css-modules#global-styles) in your application, for example:\n\n```css filename=\"app/globals.css\"\n@tailwind base;\n@tailwind components;\n@tailwind utilities;\n```\n\nInside the [root layout](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/layouts-and-templates#root-layout-required) (`app/layout.tsx`), import the `globals.css` stylesheet to apply the styles to every route in your application.\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/layout.tsx\" switcher\nimport type { Metadata } from 'next'\n\n// These styles apply to every route in the

This behavior makes CSS Modules the ideal way to include component-level CSS.\n\n## Example\n\n<AppOnly>\nCSS Modules can be imported into any file inside the `app` directory:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/dashboard/layout.tsx\" switcher\nimport styles from './styles.module.css'\n\nexport default function DashboardLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return <section className={styles.dashboard}>{children}</section>\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/dashboard/layout.js\" switcher\nimport styles from './styles.module.css'\n\nexport default function DashboardLayout({ children }) {\n  return <section className={styles.dashboard}>{children}</section>\n}\n```\n\n```css filename=\"app/dashboard/styles.module.css\"\n.dashboard {\n  padding: 24px;\n}\n```\n\n</AppOnly>\n\n<PagesOnly>\n\nFor example, consider a reusable `Button` component in the `components/` folder:\n\nFirst, create `components/Button.module.css` with the following content:\n\n```css filename=\"Button.module.css\"\n/*\nYou do not need to worry about .error {} colliding with any other `.css` or\n`.module.css` files!\n*/\n.error {\n  color: white;\n  background-color: red;\n}\n```\n\nThen, create `components/Button.js`, importing and using the above CSS file:\n\n```jsx filename=\"components/Button.js\"\nimport styles from './Button.module.css'\n\nexport function Button() {\n  return (\n    <button\n      type=\"button\"\n      // Note how the \"error\" class is accessed as a property on the imported\n      // `styles` object.\n      className={styles.error}\n    >\n      Destroy\n    </button>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n</PagesOnly>\n\nCSS Modules are **only enabled for files with the `.module.css` and `.module.sass` extensions**.\n\nIn production, all CSS Module files will be automatically concatenated into **many minified and code-split** `.css` files.\nThese `.css` files represent hot execution paths in your application, ensuring the minimal amount of CSS is loaded for your application to paint.\n\n## Global Styles\n\n<AppOnly>\nGlobal styles can be imported into any layout, page, or component inside the `app` directory.\n\n> **Good to know**: This is different from the `pages` directory, where you can only import global styles inside the `_app.js` file.\n\nFor example, consider a stylesheet named `app/global.css`:\n\n```css filename=\"app/global.css\"\nbody {\n  padding: 20px 20px 60px;\n  max-width: 680px;\n  margin: 0 auto;\n}\n```\n\nInside the root layout (`app/layout.js`), import the `global.css` stylesheet to apply the styles to every route in your application:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/layout.tsx\" switcher\n// These styles apply to every route in the application\nimport './global.css'\n\nexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <body>{children}</body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/layout.js\" switcher\n// These styles apply to every route in the application\nimport './global.css'\n\nexport default function RootLayout({ children }) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <body>{children}</body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n</AppOnly>\n\n<PagesOnly>\n\nTo add a stylesheet to your application, import the CSS file within `pages/_app.js`.\n\nFor example, consider the following stylesheet named `styles.css`:\n\n```css filename=\"styles.css\"\nbody {\n  font-family: 'SF Pro Text', 'SF Pro Icons', 'Helvetica Neue', 'Helvetica',\n    'Arial', sans-serif;\n  padding: 20px 20px 60px;\n  max-width: 680px;\n  margin: 0 auto;\n}\n```\n\nCreate a [`pages/_app.js` file](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/custom-app) if not already present.\nThen, [`import`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import) the `styles.css` file.\n\n```jsx filename=\"pages/_app.js\"\nimport '../styles.css'\n\n// This default export is required in a new `pages/_app.js` file.\nexport default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {\n  return <Component {...pageProps} />\n}\n```\n\nThese styles (`styles.css`) will apply to all pages and components in your application.\nDue to the global nature of stylesheets, and to avoid conflicts, you may **only import them inside [`pages/_app.js`](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/custom-app)**.\n\nIn development, expressing stylesheets this way allows your styles to be hot reloaded as you edit them—meaning you can keep application state.\n\nIn production, all CSS files will be automatically concatenated into a single minified `.css` file. The order that the CSS is concatenated will match the order the CSS is imported into the `_app.js` file. Pay special attention to imported JS modules that include their own CSS; the JS module's CSS will be concatenated following the same ordering rules as imported CSS files. For example:\n\n```jsx\nimport '../styles.css'\n// The CSS in ErrorBoundary depends on the global CSS in styles.css,\n// so we import it after styles.css.\nimport ErrorBoundary from '../components/ErrorBoundary'\n\nexport default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {\n  return (\n    <ErrorBoundary>\n      <Component {...pageProps} />\n    </ErrorBoundary>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n</PagesOnly>\n\n## External Stylesheets\n\n<AppOnly>\n\nStylesheets published by external packages can be imported anywhere in the `app` directory, including colocated components:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/layout.tsx\" switcher\nimport 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css'\n\nexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <body className=\"container\">{children}</body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/layout.js\" switcher\nimport 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css'\n\nexport default function RootLayout({ children }) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <body className=\"container\">{children}</body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know**: External stylesheets must be directly imported from an npm package or downloaded and colocated with your codebase. You cannot use `<link rel=\"stylesheet\" />`.\n\n</AppOnly>\n\n<PagesOnly>\n\nNext.js allows you to import CSS files from a JavaScript file.\nThis is possible because Next.js extends the concept of [`import`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import) beyond JavaScript.\n\n### Import styles from `node_modules`\n\nSince Next.js **9.5.4**, importing a CSS file from `node_modules` is permitted anywhere in your application.\n\nFor global stylesheets, like `bootstrap` or `nprogress`, you should import the file inside `pages/_app.js`.\nFor example:\n\n```jsx filename=\"pages/_app.js\"\nimport 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css'\n\nexport default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {\n  return <Component {...pageProps} />\n}\n```\n\nFor importing CSS required by a third-party component, you can do so in your component. For example:\n\n```jsx filename=\"components/example-dialog.js\"\nimport { useState } from 'react'\nimport { Dialog } from '@reach/dialog'\nimport VisuallyHidden from '@reach/visually-hidden'\nimport '@reach/dialog/styles.css'\n\nfunction ExampleDialog(props) {\n  const [showDialog, setShowDialog] = useState(false)\n  const open = () => setShowDialog(true)\n  const close = () => setShowDialog(false)\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <button onClick={open}>Open Dialog</button>\n      <Dialog isOpen={showDialog} onDismiss={close}>\n        <button className=\"close-button\" onClick={close}>\n          <VisuallyHidden>Close</VisuallyHidden>\n          <span aria-hidden>×</span>\n        </button>\n        <p>Hello there. I am a dialog</p>\n      </Dialog>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n</PagesOnly>\n\n<AppOnly>\n\n## Ordering and Merging\n\nNext.js optimizes CSS during production builds by automatically chunking (merging) stylesheets. The CSS order is determined by the order in which you import the stylesheets into your application code.\n\nFor example, `base-button.module.css` will be ordered before `page.module.css` since `<BaseButton>` is imported first in `<Page>`:\n\n```tsx filename=\"base-button.tsx\" switcher\nimport styles from './base-button.module.css'\n\nexport function BaseButton() {\n  return <button className={styles.primary} />\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"base-button.js\" switcher\nimport styles from './base-button.module.css'\n\nexport function BaseButton() {\n  return <button className={styles.primary} />\n}\n```\n\n```tsx filename=\"page.ts\" switcher\nimport { BaseButton } from './base-button'\nimport styles from './page.module.css'\n\nexport function Page() {\n  return <BaseButton className={styles.primary} />\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"page.js\" switcher\nimport { BaseButton } from './base-button'\nimport styles from './page.module.css'\n\nexport function Page() {\n  return <BaseButton className={styles.primary} />\n}\n```\n\nTo maintain a predictable order, we recommend the following:\n\n- Only import a CSS file in a single JS/TS file.\n  - If using global class names, import the global styles in the same file in the order you want them to be applied.\n- Prefer CSS Modules over global styles.\n  - Use a consistent naming convention for your CSS modules. For example, using `<name>.module.css` over `<name>.tsx`.\n- Extract shared styles into a separate shared component.\n- If using [Tailwind](/docs/app/building-your-application/styling/tailwind-css), import the stylesheet at the top of the file, preferably in the [Root Layout](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/layouts-and-templates#root-layout-required).\n\n> **Good to know:** CSS ordering behaves differently in development mode, always ensure to check preview deployments to verify the final CSS order in your production build.\n\n</AppOnly>\n\n## Additional Features\n\nNext.js includes additional features to improve the authoring experience of adding styles:\n\n- When running locally with `next dev`, local stylesheets (either global or CSS modules) will take advantage of [Fast Refresh](/docs/architecture/fast-refresh) to instantly reflect changes as edits are saved.\n- When building for production with `next build`, CSS files will be bundled into fewer minified `.css` files to reduce the number of network requests needed to retrieve styles.\n- If you disable JavaScript, styles will still be loaded in the production build (`next start`). However, JavaScript is still required for `next dev` to enable [Fast Refresh](/docs/architecture/fast-refresh).\n"},{"path":"docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/05-styling/04-css-in-js.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/05-styling/04-css-in-js.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/styling/css-in-js","sha":"f22def3430ee71809e41b1c4e43fcfe3d0a18e60","size":11483,"content":"---\ntitle: CSS-in-JS\ndescription: Use CSS-in-JS libraries with Next.js\n---\n\n{/* The content of this doc is shared between the app and pages router.

Using CSS-in-JS with newer React features like Server Components and Streaming requires library authors to support the latest version of React, including [concurrent rendering](https://react.dev/blog/2022/03/29/react-v18#what-is-concurrent-react).\n>\n> We're working with the React team on upstream APIs to handle CSS and JavaScript assets with support for React Server Components and streaming architecture.\n\nThe following libraries are supported in Client Components in the `app` directory (alphabetical):\n\n- [`ant-design`](https://ant.design/docs/react/use-with-next#using-app-router)\n- [`chakra-ui`](https://chakra-ui.com/getting-started/nextjs-app-guide)\n- [`@fluentui/react-components`](https://react.fluentui.dev/?path=/docs/concepts-developer-server-side-rendering-next-js-appdir-setup--page)\n- [`kuma-ui`](https://kuma-ui.com)\n- [`@mui/material`](https://mui.com/material-ui/guides/next-js-app-router/)\n- [`@mui/joy`](https://mui.com/joy-ui/integrations/next-js-app-router/)\n- [`pandacss`](https://panda-css.com)\n- [`styled-jsx`](#styled-jsx)\n- [`styled-components`](#styled-components)\n- [`stylex`](https://stylexjs.com)\n- [`tamagui`](https://tamagui.dev/docs/guides/next-js#server-components)\n- [`tss-react`](https://tss-react.dev/)\n- [`vanilla-extract`](https://vanilla-extract.style)\n\nThe following are currently working on support:\n\n- [`emotion`](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion/issues/2928)\n\n> **Good to know**: We're testing out different CSS-in-JS libraries and we'll be adding more examples for libraries that support React 18 features and/or the `app` directory.\n\nIf you want to style Server Components, we recommend using [CSS Modules](/docs/app/building-your-application/styling/css-modules) or other solutions that output CSS files, like PostCSS or [Tailwind CSS](/docs/app/building-your-application/styling/tailwind-css).\n\n## Configuring CSS-in-JS in `app`\n\nConfiguring CSS-in-JS is a three-step opt-in process that involves:\n\n1. A **style registry** to collect all CSS rules in a render.\n2. The new `useServerInsertedHTML` hook to inject rules before any content that might use them.\n3. A Client Component that wraps your app with the style registry during initial server-side rendering.\n\n### `styled-jsx`\n\nUsing `styled-jsx` in Client Components requires using `v5.1.0`. First, create a new registry:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/registry.tsx\" switcher\n'use client'\n\nimport React, { useState } from 'react'\nimport { useServerInsertedHTML } from 'next/navigation'\nimport { StyleRegistry, createStyleRegistry } from 'styled-jsx'\n\nexport default function StyledJsxRegistry({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  // Only create stylesheet once with lazy initial state\n  // x-ref: https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#lazy-initial-state\n  const [jsxStyleRegistry] = useState(() => createStyleRegistry())\n\n  useServerInsertedHTML(() => {\n    const styles = jsxStyleRegistry.styles()\n    jsxStyleRegistry.flush()\n    return <>{styles}</>\n  })\n\n  return <StyleRegistry registry={jsxStyleRegistry}>{children}</StyleRegistry>\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/registry.js\" switcher\n'use client'\n\nimport React, { useState } from 'react'\nimport { useServerInsertedHTML } from 'next/navigation'\nimport { StyleRegistry, createStyleRegistry } from 'styled-jsx'\n\nexport default function StyledJsxRegistry({ children }) {\n  // Only create stylesheet once with lazy initial state\n  // x-ref: https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#lazy-initial-state\n  const [jsxStyleRegistry] = useState(() => createStyleRegistry())\n\n  useServerInsertedHTML(() => {\n    const styles = jsxStyleRegistry.styles()\n    jsxStyleRegistry.flush()\n    return <>{styles}</>\n  })\n\n  return <StyleRegistry registry={jsxStyleRegistry}>{children}</StyleRegistry>\n}\n```\n\nThen, wrap your [root layout](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/layouts-and-templates#root-layout-required) with the registry:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/layout.tsx\" switcher\nimport StyledJsxRegistry from './registry'\n\nexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html>\n      <body>\n        <StyledJsxRegistry>{children}</StyledJsxRegistry>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/layout.js\" switcher\nimport StyledJsxRegistry from './registry'\n\nexport default function RootLayout({ children }) {\n  return (\n    <html>\n      <body>\n        <StyledJsxRegistry>{children}</StyledJsxRegistry>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n[View an example here](https://github.com/vercel/app-playground/tree/main/app/styling/styled-jsx).\n\n### Styled Components\n\nBelow is an example of how to configure `styled-components@6` or newer:\n\nFirst, enable styled-components in `next.config.js`.\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  compiler: {\n    styledComponents: true,\n  },\n}\n```\n\nThen, use the `styled-components` API to create a global registry component to collect all CSS style rules generated during a render, and a function to return those rules. Then use the `useServerInsertedHTML` hook to inject the styles collected in the registry into the `<head>` HTML tag in the root layout.\n\n```tsx filename=\"lib/registry.tsx\" switcher\n'use client'\n\nimport React, { useState } from 'react'\nimport { useServerInsertedHTML } from 'next/navigation'\nimport { ServerStyleSheet, StyleSheetManager } from 'styled-components'\n\nexport default function StyledComponentsRegistry({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  // Only create stylesheet once with lazy initial state\n  // x-ref: https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#lazy-initial-state\n  const [styledComponentsStyleSheet] = useState(() => new ServerStyleSheet())\n\n  useServerInsertedHTML(() => {\n    const styles = styledComponentsStyleSheet.getStyleElement()\n    styledComponentsStyleSheet.instance.clearTag()\n    return <>{styles}</>\n  })\n\n  if (typeof window !== 'undefined') return <>{children}</>\n\n  return (\n    <StyleSheetManager sheet={styledComponentsStyleSheet.instance}>\n      {children}\n    </StyleSheetManager>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"lib/registry.js\" switcher\n'use client'\n\nimport React, { useState } from 'react'\nimport { useServerInsertedHTML } from 'next/navigation'\nimport { ServerStyleSheet, StyleSheetManager } from 'styled-components'\n\nexport default function StyledComponentsRegistry({ children }) {\n  // Only create stylesheet once with lazy initial state\n  // x-ref: https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#lazy-initial-state\n  const [styledComponentsStyleSheet] = useState(() => new ServerStyleSheet())\n\n  useServerInsertedHTML(() => {\n    const styles = styledComponentsStyleSheet.getStyleElement()\n    styledComponentsStyleSheet.instance.clearTag()\n    return <>{styles}</>\n  })\n\n  if (typeof window !== 'undefined') return <>{children}</>\n\n  return (\n    <StyleSheetManager sheet={styledComponentsStyleSheet.instance}>\n      {children}\n    </StyleSheetManager>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nWrap the `children` of the root layout with the style registry component:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/layout.tsx\" switcher\nimport StyledComponentsRegistry from './lib/registry'\n\nexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html>\n      <body>\n        <StyledComponentsRegistry>{children}</StyledComponentsRegistry>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/layout.js\" switcher\nimport StyledComponentsRegistry from './lib/registry'\n\nexport default function RootLayout({ children }) {\n  return (\n    <html>\n      <body>\n        <StyledComponentsRegistry>{children}</StyledComponentsRegistry>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n[View an example here](https://github.com/vercel/app-playground/tree/main/app/styling/styled-components).\n\n> **Good to know**:\n>\n> - During server rendering, styles will be extracted to a global registry and flushed to the `<head>` of your HTML. This ensures the style rules are placed before any content that might use them. In the future, we may use an upcoming React feature to determine where to inject the styles.\n> - During streaming, styles from each chunk will be collected and appended to existing styles. After client-side hydration is complete, `styled-components` will take over as usual and inject any further dynamic styles.\n> - We specifically use a Client Component at the top level of the tree for the style registry because it's more efficient to extract CSS rules this way. It avoids re-generating styles on subsequent server renders, and prevents them from being sent in the Server Component payload.\n> - For advanced use cases where you need to configure individual properties of styled-components compilation, you can read our [Next.js styled-components API reference](/docs/architecture/nextjs-compiler#styled-components) to learn more.\n\n</AppOnly>\n\n<PagesOnly>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Examples</summary>\n\n- [Styled JSX](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-styled-jsx)\n- [Styled Components](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-styled-components)\n- [Emotion](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-emotion)\n- [Linaria](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-linaria)\n- [Styletron](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-styletron)\n- [Cxs](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-cxs)\n- [Fela](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-fela)\n- [Stitches](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-stitches)\n\n</details>\n\nIt's possible to use any existing CSS-in-JS solution. The simplest one is inline styles:\n\n```jsx\nfunction HiThere() {\n  return <p style={{ color: 'red' }}>hi there</p>\n}\n\nexport default HiThere\n```\n\nWe bundle [styled-jsx](https://github.com/vercel/styled-jsx) to provide support for isolated scoped CSS.\nThe aim is to support \"shadow CSS\" similar to Web Components, which unfortunately [do not support server-rendering and are JS-only](https://github.com/w3c/webcomponents/issues/71).\n\nSee the above examples for other popular CSS-in-JS solutions (like Styled Components).\n\nA component using `styled-jsx` looks like this:\n\n```jsx\nfunction HelloWorld() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      Hello world\n      <p>scoped!</p>\n      <style jsx>{`\n        p {\n          color: blue;\n        }\n        div {\n          background: red;\n        }\n        @media (max-width: 600px) {\n          div {\n            background: blue;\n          }\n        }\n      `}</style>\n      <style global jsx>{`\n        body {\n          background: black;\n        }\n      `}</style>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default HelloWorld\n```\n\nPlease see the [styled-jsx documentation](https://github.com/vercel/styled-jsx) for more examples.\n\n### Disabling JavaScript\n\nYes, if you disable JavaScript the CSS will still be loaded in the production build (`next start`). During development, we require JavaScript to be enabled to provide the best developer experience with [Fast Refresh](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-9-4#fast-refresh).\n\n</PagesOnly>\n"},{"path":"docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/05-styling/03-sass.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/05-styling/03-sass.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/styling/sass","sha":"6a8f4ea649c668e46a6e9bd1a923f7bae6f03357","size":2304,"content":"---\ntitle: Sass\ndescription: Style your Next.js application using Sass.\n---\n\n{/* The content of this doc is shared between the app and pages router.

Any shared content should not be wrapped in a component. */}\n\nNext.js has built-in support for integrating with Sass after the package is installed using both the `.scss` and `.sass` extensions. You can use component-level Sass via CSS Modules and the `.module.scss`or `.module.sass` extension.\n\nFirst, install [`sass`](https://github.com/sass/sass):\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nnpm install --save-dev sass\n```\n\n> **Good to know**:\n>\n> Sass supports [two different syntaxes](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax), each with their own extension.\n> The `.scss` extension requires you use the [SCSS syntax](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax#scss),\n> while the `.sass` extension requires you use the [Indented Syntax (\"Sass\")](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax#the-indented-syntax).\n>\n> If you're not sure which to choose, start with the `.scss` extension which is a superset of CSS, and doesn't require you learn the\n> Indented Syntax (\"Sass\").\n\n### Customizing Sass Options\n\nIf you want to configure the Sass compiler, use `sassOptions` in `next.config.js`.\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nconst path = require('path')\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  sassOptions: {\n    includePaths: [path.join(__dirname, 'styles')],\n  },\n}\n```\n\n### Sass Variables\n\nNext.js supports Sass variables exported from CSS Module files.\n\nFor example, using the exported `primaryColor` Sass variable:\n\n```scss filename=\"app/variables.module.scss\"\n$primary-color: #64ff00;\n\n:export {\n  primaryColor: $primary-color;\n}\n```\n\n<AppOnly>\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/page.js\"\n// maps to root `/` URL\n\nimport variables from './variables.module.scss'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return <h1 style={{ color: variables.primaryColor }}>Hello, Next.js!</h1>\n}\n```\n\n</AppOnly>\n\n<PagesOnly>\n\n```jsx filename=\"pages/_app.js\"\nimport variables from '../styles/variables.module.scss'\n\nexport default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {\n  return (\n    <Layout color={variables.primaryColor}>\n      <Component {...pageProps} />\n    </Layout>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n</PagesOnly>\n"},{"path":"docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/03-rendering/04-composition-patterns.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/03-rendering/04-composition-patterns.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/composition-patterns","sha":"f129b5c62e3dcb77bf6bddc7dfe802019dd53437","size":20920,"content":"---\ntitle: Server and Client Composition Patterns\nnav_title: Composition Patterns\ndescription: Recommended patterns for using Server and Client Components.\n---\n\nWhen building React applications, you will need to consider what parts of your application should be rendered on the server or the client. This page covers some recommended composition patterns when using Server and Client Components.\n\n## When to use Server and Client Components?\n\nHere's a quick summary of the different use cases for Server and Client Components:\n\n| What do you need to do?                                                            | Server Component    | Client Component    |\n| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |\n| Fetch data                                                                         | <Check size={18} /> | <Cross size={18} /> |\n| Access backend resources (directly)                                                | <Check size={18} /> | <Cross size={18} /> |\n| Keep sensitive information on the server (access tokens, API keys, etc)            | <Check size={18} /> | <Cross size={18} /> |\n| Keep large dependencies on the server / Reduce client-side JavaScript              | <Check size={18} /> | <Cross size={18} /> |\n| Add interactivity and event listeners (`onClick()`, `onChange()`, etc)             | <Cross size={18} /> | <Check size={18} /> |\n| Use State and Lifecycle Effects (`useState()`, `useReducer()`, `useEffect()`, etc) | <Cross size={18} /> | <Check size={18} /> |\n| Use browser-only APIs                                                              | <Cross size={18} /> | <Check size={18} /> |\n| Use custom hooks that depend on state, effects, or browser-only APIs               | <Cross size={18} /> | <Check size={18} /> |\n| Use [React Class components](https://react.dev/reference/react/Component)          | <Cross size={18} /> | <Check size={18} /> |\n\n## Server Component Patterns\n\nBefore opting into client-side rendering, you may wish to do some work on the server like fetching data, or accessing your database or backend services.\n\nHere are some common patterns when working with Server Components:\n\n### Sharing data between components\n\nWhen fetching data on the server, there may be cases where you need to share data across different components. For example, you may have a layout and a page that depend on the same data.\n\nInstead of using [React Context](https://react.dev/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context) (which is not available on the server) or passing data as props, you can use [`fetch`](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/caching-and-revalidating#fetch-requests) or React's `cache` function to fetch the same data in the components that need it, without worrying about making duplicate requests for the same data. This is because React extends `fetch` to automatically memoize data requests, and the `cache` function can be used when `fetch` is not available.\n\nLearn more about [memoization](/docs/app/building-your-application/caching#request-memoization) in React.\n\n### Keeping Server-only Code out of the Client Environment\n\nSince JavaScript modules can be shared between both Server and Client Components modules, it's possible for code that was only ever intended to be run on the server to sneak its way into the client.\n\nFor example, take the following data-fetching function:\n\n```ts filename=\"lib/data.ts\" switcher\nexport async function getData() {\n  const res = await fetch('https://external-service.com/data', {\n    headers: {\n      authorization: process.env.API_KEY,\n    },\n  })\n\n  return res.json()\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"lib/data.js\" switcher\nexport async function getData() {\n  const res = await fetch('https://external-service.com/data', {\n    headers: {\n      authorization: process.env.API_KEY,\n    },\n  })\n\n  return res.json()\n}\n```\n\nAt first glance, it appears that `getData` works on both the server and the client. However, this function contains an `API_KEY`, written with the intention that it would only ever be executed on the server.\n\nSince the environment variable `API_KEY` is not prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC`, it's a private variable that can only be accessed on the server. To prevent your environment variables from being leaked to the client, Next.js replaces private environment variables with an empty string.\n\nAs a result, even though `getData()` can be imported and executed on the client, it won't work as expected. And while making the variable public would make the function work on the client, you may not want to expose sensitive information to the client.\n\nTo prevent this sort of unintended client usage of server code, we can use the `server-only` package to give other developers a build-time error if they ever accidentally import one of these modules into a Client Component.\n\nTo use `server-only`, first install the package:\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nnpm install server-only\n```\n\nThen import the package into any module that contains server-only code:\n\n```js filename=\"lib/data.js\"\nimport 'server-only'\n\nexport async function getData() {\n  const res = await fetch('https://external-service.com/data', {\n    headers: {\n      authorization: process.env.API_KEY,\n    },\n  })\n\n  return res.json()\n}\n```\n\nNow, any Client Component that imports `getData()` will receive a build-time error explaining that this module can only be used on the server.\n\nThe corresponding package `client-only` can be used to mark modules that contain client-only code – for example, code that accesses the `window` object.\n\n### Using Third-party Packages and Providers\n\nSince Server Components are a new React feature, third-party packages and providers in the ecosystem are just beginning to add the `\"use client\"` directive to components that use client-only features like `useState`, `useEffect`, and `createContext`.\n\nToday, many components from `npm` packages that use client-only features do not yet have the directive. These third-party components will work as expected within Client Components since they have the `\"use client\"` directive, but they won't work within Server Components.\n\nFor example, let's say you've installed the hypothetical `acme-carousel` package which has a `<Carousel />` component. This component uses `useState`, but it doesn't yet have the `\"use client\"` directive.\n\nIf you use `<Carousel />` within a Client Component, it will work as expected:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/gallery.tsx\" switcher\n'use client'\n\nimport { useState } from 'react'\nimport { Carousel } from 'acme-carousel'\n\nexport default function Gallery() {\n  let [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false)\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <button onClick={() => setIsOpen(true)}>View pictures</button>\n\n      {/* Works, since Carousel is used within a Client Component */}\n      {isOpen && <Carousel />}\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/gallery.js\" switcher\n'use client'\n\nimport { useState } from 'react'\nimport { Carousel } from 'acme-carousel'\n\nexport default function Gallery() {\n  let [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false)\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <button onClick={() => setIsOpen(true)}>View pictures</button>\n\n      {/*  Works, since Carousel is used within a Client Component */}\n      {isOpen && <Carousel />}\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nHowever, if you try to use it directly within a Server Component, you'll see an error:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/page.tsx\" switcher\nimport { Carousel } from 'acme-carousel'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <p>View pictures</p>\n\n      {/* Error: `useState` can not be used within Server Components */}\n      <Carousel />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/page.js\" switcher\nimport { Carousel } from 'acme-carousel'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <p>View pictures</p>\n\n      {/*  Error: `useState` can not be used within Server Components */}\n      <Carousel />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nThis is because Next.js doesn't know `<Carousel />` is using client-only features.\n\nTo fix this, you can wrap third-party components that rely on client-only features in your own Client Components:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/carousel.tsx\" switcher\n'use client'\n\nimport { Carousel } from 'acme-carousel'\n\nexport default Carousel\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/carousel.js\" switcher\n'use client'\n\nimport { Carousel } from 'acme-carousel'\n\nexport default Carousel\n```\n\nNow, you can use `<Carousel />` directly within a Server Component:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/page.tsx\" switcher\nimport Carousel from './carousel'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <p>View pictures</p>\n\n      {/*  Works, since Carousel is a Client Component */}\n      <Carousel />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/page.js\" switcher\nimport Carousel from './carousel'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <p>View pictures</p>\n\n      {/*  Works, since Carousel is a Client Component */}\n      <Carousel />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nWe don't expect you to need to wrap most third-party components since it's likely you'll be using them within Client Components. However, one exception is providers, since they rely on React state and context, and are typically needed at the root of an application. [Learn more about third-party context providers below](#using-context-providers).\n\n#### Using Context Providers\n\nContext providers are typically rendered near the root of an application to share global concerns, like the current theme. Since [React context](https://react.dev/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context) is not supported in Server Components, trying to create a context at the root of your application will cause an error:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/layout.tsx\" switcher\nimport { createContext } from 'react'\n\n//  createContext is not supported in Server Components\nexport const ThemeContext = createContext({})\n\nexport default function RootLayout({ children }) {\n  return (\n    <html>\n      <body>\n        <ThemeContext.Provider value=\"dark\">{children}</ThemeContext.Provider>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/layout.js\" switcher\nimport { createContext } from 'react'\n\n//  createContext is not supported in Server Components\nexport const ThemeContext = createContext({})\n\nexport default function RootLayout({ children }) {\n  return (\n    <html>\n      <body>\n        <ThemeContext.Provider value=\"dark\">{children}</ThemeContext.Provider>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nTo fix this, create your context and render its provider inside of a Client Component:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/theme-provider.tsx\" switcher\n'use client'\n\nimport { createContext } from 'react'\n\nexport const ThemeContext = createContext({})\n\nexport default function ThemeProvider({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return <ThemeContext.Provider value=\"dark\">{children}</ThemeContext.Provider>\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/theme-provider.js\" switcher\n'use client'\n\nimport { createContext } from 'react'\n\nexport const ThemeContext = createContext({})\n\nexport default function ThemeProvider({ children }) {\n  return <ThemeContext.Provider value=\"dark\">{children}</ThemeContext.Provider>\n}\n```\n\nYour Server Component will now be able to directly render your provider since it's been marked as a Client Component:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/layout.tsx\" switcher\nimport ThemeProvider from './theme-provider'\n\nexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html>\n      <body>\n        <ThemeProvider>{children}</ThemeProvider>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/layout.js\" switcher\nimport ThemeProvider from './theme-provider'\n\nexport default function RootLayout({ children }) {\n  return (\n    <html>\n      <body>\n        <ThemeProvider>{children}</ThemeProvider>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nWith the provider rendered at the root, all other Client Components throughout your app will be able to consume this context.\n\n> **Good to know**: You should render providers as deep as possible in the tree – notice how `ThemeProvider` only wraps `{children}` instead of the entire `<html>` document. This makes it easier for Next.js to optimize the static parts of your Server Components.\n\n#### Advice for Library Authors\n\nIn a similar fashion, library authors creating packages to be consumed by other developers can use the `\"use client\"` directive to mark client entry points of their package. This allows users of the package to import package components directly into their Server Components without having to create a wrapping boundary.\n\nYou can optimize your package by using ['use client' deeper in the tree](#moving-client-components-down-the-tree), allowing the imported modules to be part of the Server Component module graph.\n\nIt's worth noting some bundlers might strip out `\"use client\"` directives. You can find an example of how to configure esbuild to include the `\"use client\"` directive in the [React Wrap Balancer](https://github.com/shuding/react-wrap-balancer/blob/main/tsup.config.ts#L10-L13) and [Vercel Analytics](https://github.com/vercel/analytics/blob/main/packages/web/tsup.config.js#L26-L30) repositories.\n\n## Client Components\n\n### Moving Client Components Down the Tree\n\nTo reduce the Client JavaScript bundle size, we recommend moving Client Components down your component tree.\n\nFor example, you may have a Layout that has static elements (e.g. logo, links, etc) and an interactive search bar that uses state.\n\nInstead of making the whole layout a Client Component, move the interactive logic to a Client Component (e.g. `<SearchBar />`) and keep your layout as a Server Component. This means you don't have to send all the component Javascript of the layout to the client.\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/layout.tsx\" switcher\n// SearchBar is a Client Component\nimport SearchBar from './searchbar'\n// Logo is a Server Component\nimport Logo from './logo'\n\n// Layout is a Server Component by default\nexport default function Layout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <nav>\n        <Logo />\n        <SearchBar />\n      </nav>\n      <main>{children}</main>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/layout.js\" switcher\n// SearchBar is a Client Component\nimport SearchBar from './searchbar'\n// Logo is a Server Component\nimport Logo from './logo'\n\n// Layout is a Server Component by default\nexport default function Layout({ children }) {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <nav>\n        <Logo />\n        <SearchBar />\n      </nav>\n      <main>{children}</main>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### Passing props from Server to Client Components (Serialization)\n\nIf you fetch data in a Server Component, you may want to pass data down as props to Client Components. Props passed from the Server to Client Components need to be [serializable](https://react.dev/reference/react/use-server#serializable-parameters-and-return-values) by React.\n\nIf your Client Components depend on data that is not serializable, you can [fetch data on the client with a third party library](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/caching-and-revalidating#data-fetching-libraries-and-orms) or on the server via a [Route Handler](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-handlers).\n\n## Interleaving Server and Client Components\n\nWhen interleaving Client and Server Components, it may be helpful to visualize your UI as a tree of components. Starting with the [root layout](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/layouts-and-templates#root-layout-required), which is a Server Component, you can then render certain subtrees of components on the client by adding the `\"use client\"` directive.\n\n{/* Diagram - interleaving */}\n\nWithin those client subtrees, you can still nest Server Components or call Server Actions, however there are some things to keep in mind:\n\n- During a request-response lifecycle, your code moves from the server to the client. If you need to access data or resources on the server while on the client, you'll be making a **new** request to the server - not switching back and forth.\n- When a new request is made to the server, all Server Components are rendered first, including those nested inside Client Components. The rendered result ([RSC Payload](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components#what-is-the-react-server-component-payload-rsc)) will contain references to the locations of Client Components. Then, on the client, React uses the RSC Payload to reconcile Server and Client Components into a single tree.\n\n{/* Diagram */}\n\n- Since Client Components are rendered after Server Components, you cannot import a Server Component into a Client Component module (since it would require a new request back to the server). Instead, you can pass a Server Component as `props` to a Client Component. See the [unsupported pattern](#unsupported-pattern-importing-server-components-into-client-components) and [supported pattern](#supported-pattern-passing-server-components-to-client-components-as-props) sections below.\n\n### Unsupported Pattern: Importing Server Components into Client Components\n\nThe following pattern is not supported. You cannot import a Server Component into a Client Component:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/client-component.tsx\" switcher highlight={4,17}\n'use client'\n\n// You cannot import a Server Component into a Client Component.\nimport ServerComponent from './Server-Component'\n\nexport default function ClientComponent({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>{count}</button>\n\n      <ServerComponent />\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/client-component.js\" switcher highlight={3,13}\n'use client'\n\n// You cannot import a Server Component into a Client Component.\nimport ServerComponent from './Server-Component'\n\nexport default function ClientComponent({ children }) {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>{count}</button>\n\n      <ServerComponent />\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### Supported Pattern: Passing Server Components to Client Components as Props\n\nThe following pattern is supported. You can pass Server Components as a prop to a Client Component.\n\nA common pattern is to use the React `children` prop to create a _\"slot\"_ in your Client Component.\n\nIn the example below, `<ClientComponent>` accepts a `children` prop:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/client-component.tsx\" switcher highlight={6,15}\n'use client'\n\nimport { useState } from 'react'\n\nexport default function ClientComponent({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>{count}</button>\n      {children}\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/client-component.js\" switcher highlight={5,12}\n'use client'\n\nimport { useState } from 'react'\n\nexport default function ClientComponent({ children }) {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>{count}</button>\n\n      {children}\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n`<ClientComponent>` doesn't know that `children` will eventually be filled in by the result of a Server Component. The only responsibility `<ClientComponent>` has is to decide **where** `children` will eventually be placed.\n\nIn a parent Server Component, you can import both the `<ClientComponent>` and `<ServerComponent>` and pass `<ServerComponent>` as a child of `<ClientComponent>`:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/page.tsx\"  highlight={11} switcher\n// This pattern works:\n// You can pass a Server Component as a child or prop of a\n// Client Component.\nimport ClientComponent from './client-component'\nimport ServerComponent from './server-component'\n\n// Pages in Next.js are Server Components by default\nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <ClientComponent>\n      <ServerComponent />\n    </ClientComponent>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/page.js\" highlight={11} switcher\n// This pattern works:\n// You can pass a Server Component as a child or prop of a\n// Client Component.\nimport ClientComponent from './client-component'\nimport ServerComponent from './server-component'\n\n// Pages in Next.js are Server Components by default\nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <ClientComponent>\n      <ServerComponent />\n    </ClientComponent>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nWith this approach, `<ClientComponent>` and `<ServerComponent>` are decoupled and can be rendered independently. In this case, the child `<ServerComponent>` can be rendered on the server, well before `<ClientComponent>` is rendered on the client.\n\n> **Good to know:**\n>\n> - The pattern of \"lifting content up\" has been used to avoid re-rendering a nested child component when a parent component re-renders.\n> - You're not limited to the `children` prop. You can use any prop to pass JSX.\n"},{"path":"docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/03-rendering/index.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/03-rendering/index.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering","sha":"ad3c347a2569f673e7434a465aff3eaaee4dfa9d","size":6027,"content":"---\ntitle: Rendering\ndescription: Learn the differences between Next.js rendering environments, strategies, and runtimes.\n---\n\nRendering converts the code you write into user interfaces. React and Next.js allow you to create hybrid web applications where parts of your code can be rendered on the server or the client. This section will help you understand the differences between these rendering environments, strategies, and runtimes.\n\n## Fundamentals\n\nTo start, it's helpful to be familiar with three foundational web concepts:\n\n- The [Environments](#rendering-environments) your application code can be executed in: the server and the client.\n- The [Request-Response Lifecycle](#request-response-lifecycle) that's initiated when a user visits or interacts with your application.\n- The [Network Boundary](#network-boundary) that separates server and client code.\n\n### Rendering Environments\n\nThere are two environments where web applications can be rendered: the client and the server.\n\n<Image\n  alt=\"Client and Server Environments\"\n  srcLight=\"/docs/light/client-and-server-environments.png\"\n  srcDark=\"/docs/dark/client-and-server-environments.png\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"672\"\n/>\n\n- The **client** refers to the browser on a user's device that sends a request to a server for your application code. It then turns the response from the server into a user interface.\n- The **server** refers to the computer in a data center that stores your application code, receives requests from a client, and sends back an appropriate response.\n\nHistorically, developers had to use different languages (e.g. JavaScript, PHP) and frameworks when writing code for the server and the client. With React, developers can use the **same language** (JavaScript), and the **same framework** (e.g. Next.js or your framework of choice). This flexibility allows you to seamlessly write code for both environments without context switching.\n\nHowever, each environment has its own set of capabilities and constraints. Therefore, the code you write for the server and the client is not always the same. There are certain operations (e.g. data fetching or managing user state) that are better suited for one environment over the other.\n\nUnderstanding these differences is key to effectively using React and Next.js. We'll cover the differences and use cases in more detail on the [Server](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components) and [Client](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/client-components) Components pages, for now, let's continue building on our foundation.\n\n### Request-Response Lifecycle\n\nBroadly speaking, all websites follow the same **Request-Response Lifecycle**:\n\n1. **User Action:** The user interacts with a web application. This could be clicking a link, submitting a form, or typing a URL directly into the browser's address bar.\n2. **HTTP Request:** The client sends an [HTTP](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP) request to the server that contains necessary information about what resources are being requested, what method is being used (e.g. `GET`, `POST`), and additional data if necessary.\n3. **Server:** The server processes the request and responds with the appropriate resources. This process may take a couple of steps like routing, fetching data, etc.\n4. **HTTP Response:** After processing the request, the server sends an HTTP response back to the client. This response contains a status code (which tells the client whether the request was successful or not) and requested resources (e.g. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, static assets, etc).\n5. **Client:** The client parses the resources to render the user interface.\n6. **User Action:** Once the user interface is rendered, the user can interact with it, and the whole process starts again.\n\nA major part of building a hybrid web application is deciding how to split the work in the lifecycle, and where to place the Network Boundary.\n\n### Network Boundary\n\nIn web development, the **Network Boundary** is a conceptual line that separates the different environments. For example, the client and the server, or the server and the data store.\n\n{/* Diagram: Network Boundary */}\n\nIn React, you choose where to place the client-server network boundary wherever it makes the most sense.\n\nBehind the scenes, the work is split into two parts: the **client module graph** and the **server module graph**. The server module graph contains all the components that are rendered on the server, and the client module graph contains all components that are rendered on the client.\n\n{/* Diagram: Client and Server Module Graphs */}\n\nIt may be helpful to think about module graphs as a visual representation of how files in your application depend on each other.\n\n{/* For example, if you have a file called `Page.jsx` that imports a file called `Button.jsx` on the server, the module graph would look something like this: - Diagram - */}\n\nYou can use the React `\"use client\"` convention to define the boundary. There's also a `\"use server\"` convention, which tells React to do some computational work on the server.\n\n## Building Hybrid Applications\n\nWhen working in these environments, it's helpful to think of the flow of the code in your application as **unidirectional**. In other words, during a response, your application code flows in one direction: from the server to the client.\n\n{/* Diagram: Response flow */}\n\nIf you need to access the server from the client, you send a **new** request to the server rather than re-use the same request. This makes it easier to understand where to render your components and where to place the Network Boundary.\n\nIn practice, this model encourages developers to think about what they want to execute on the server first, before sending the result to the client and making the application interactive.\n\nThis concept will become clearer when we look at how you can [interleave client and server components](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/composition-patterns) in the same component tree.\n"},{"path":"docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/03-rendering/02-server-components.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/03-rendering/02-server-components.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components","sha":"638087a90220fc836e07db5672fdd132b31e5692","size":9852,"content":"---\ntitle: Server Components\ndescription: Learn how you can use React Server Components to render parts of your application on the server.\nrelated:\n  description: Learn how Next.js caches data and the result of static rendering.\n  links:\n    - app/building-your-application/caching\n---\n\nReact Server Components allow you to write UI that can be rendered and optionally cached on the server. In Next.js, the rendering work is further split by route segments to enable streaming and partial rendering, and there are three different server rendering strategies:\n\n- [Static Rendering](#static-rendering-default)\n- [Dynamic Rendering](#dynamic-rendering)\n- [Streaming](#streaming)\n\nThis page will go through how Server Components work, when you might use them, and the different server rendering strategies.\n\n## Benefits of Server Rendering\n\nThere are a couple of benefits to doing the rendering work on the server, including:\n\n- **Data Fetching**: Server Components allow you to move data fetching to the server, closer to your data source. This can improve performance by reducing time it takes to fetch data needed for rendering, and the number of requests the client needs to make.\n- **Security**: Server Components allow you to keep sensitive data and logic on the server, such as tokens and API keys, without the risk of exposing them to the client.\n- **Caching**: By rendering on the server, the result can be cached and reused on subsequent requests and across users. This can improve performance and reduce cost by reducing the amount of rendering and data fetching done on each request.\n- **Performance**: Server Components give you additional tools to optimize performance from the baseline. For example, if you start with an app composed of entirely Client Components, moving non-interactive pieces of your UI to Server Components can reduce the amount of client-side JavaScript needed. This is beneficial for users with slower internet or less powerful devices, as the browser has less client-side JavaScript to download, parse, and execute.\n- **Initial Page Load and [First Contentful Paint (FCP)](https://web.dev/fcp/)**: On the server, we can generate HTML to allow users to view the page immediately, without waiting for the client to download, parse and execute the JavaScript needed to render the page.\n- **Search Engine Optimization and Social Network Shareability**: The rendered HTML can be used by search engine bots to index your pages and social network bots to generate social card previews for your pages.\n- **Streaming**: Server Components allow you to split the rendering work into chunks and stream them to the client as they become ready. This allows the user to see parts of the page earlier without having to wait for the entire page to be rendered on the server.\n\n## Using Server Components in Next.js\n\nBy default, Next.js uses Server Components. This allows you to automatically implement server rendering with no additional configuration, and you can opt into using Client Components when needed, see [Client Components](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/client-components).\n\n## How are Server Components rendered?\n\nOn the server, Next.js uses React's APIs to orchestrate rendering. The rendering work is split into chunks: by individual route segments and [Suspense Boundaries](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense).\n\nEach chunk is rendered in two steps:\n\n1. React renders Server Components into a special data format called the **React Server Component Payload (RSC Payload)**.\n2. Next.js uses the RSC Payload and Client Component JavaScript instructions to render **HTML** on the server.\n\n{/* Rendering Diagram */}\n\nThen, on the client:\n\n1. The HTML is used to immediately show a fast non-interactive preview of the route - this is for the initial page load only.\n2. The React Server Components Payload is used to reconcile the Client and Server Component trees, and update the DOM.\n3. The JavaScript instructions are used to [hydrate](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/client/hydrateRoot) Client Components and make the application interactive.\n\n> #### What is the React Server Component Payload (RSC)?\n>\n> The RSC Payload is a compact binary representation of the rendered React Server Components tree. It's used by React on the client to update the browser's DOM. The RSC Payload contains:\n>\n> - The rendered result of Server Components\n> - Placeholders for where Client Components should be rendered and references to their JavaScript files\n> - Any props passed from a Server Component to a Client Component\n\n## Server Rendering Strategies\n\nThere are three subsets of server rendering: Static, Dynamic, and Streaming.\n\n### Static Rendering (Default)\n\n{/* Static Rendering Diagram */}\n\nWith Static Rendering, routes are rendered at **build time**, or in the background after [data revalidation](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/caching-and-revalidating#revalidating-data). The result is cached and can be pushed to a [Content Delivery Network (CDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Glossary/CDN). This optimization allows you to share the result of the rendering work between users and server requests.\n\nStatic rendering is useful when a route has data that is not personalized to the user and can be known at build time, such as a static blog post or a product page.\n\n### Dynamic Rendering\n\n{/* Dynamic Rendering Diagram */}\n\nWith Dynamic Rendering, routes are rendered for each user at **request time**.\n\nDynamic rendering is useful when a route has data that is personalized to the user or has information that can only be known at request time, such as cookies or the URL's search params.\n\n> **Dynamic Routes with Cached Data**\n>\n> In most websites, routes are not fully static or fully dynamic - it's a spectrum. For example, you can have an e-commerce page that uses cached product data that's revalidated at an interval, but also has uncached, personalized customer data.\n>\n> In Next.js, you can have dynamically rendered routes that have both cached and uncached data. This is because the RSC Payload and data are cached separately. This allows you to opt into dynamic rendering without worrying about the performance impact of fetching all the data at request time.\n>\n> Learn more about the [full-route cache](/docs/app/building-your-application/caching#full-route-cache) and [Data Cache](/docs/app/building-your-application/caching#data-cache).\n\n#### Switching to Dynamic Rendering\n\nDuring rendering, if a [dynamic function](#dynamic-functions) or [uncached data request](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/caching-and-revalidating) is discovered, Next.js will switch to dynamically rendering the whole route. This table summarizes how dynamic functions and data caching affect whether a route is statically or dynamically rendered:\n\n| Dynamic Functions | Data       | Route                |\n| ----------------- | ---------- | -------------------- |\n| No                | Cached     | Statically Rendered  |\n| Yes               | Cached     | Dynamically Rendered |\n| No                | Not Cached | Dynamically Rendered |\n| Yes               | Not Cached | Dynamically Rendered |\n\nIn the table above, for a route to be fully static, all data must be cached. However, you can have a dynamically rendered route that uses both cached and uncached data fetches.\n\nAs a developer, you do not need to choose between static and dynamic rendering as Next.js will automatically choose the best rendering strategy for each route based on the features and APIs used. Instead, you choose when to [cache or revalidate specific data](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/caching-and-revalidating), and you may choose to [stream](#streaming) parts of your UI.\n\n#### Dynamic Functions\n\nDynamic functions rely on information that can only be known at request time such as a user's cookies, current requests headers, or the URL's search params. In Next.js, these dynamic APIs are:\n\n- [`cookies()`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/cookies)\n- [`headers()`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/headers)\n- [`unstable_noStore()`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/unstable_noStore)\n- [`unstable_after()`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/unstable_after):\n- [`searchParams` prop](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/page#searchparams-optional)\n\nUsing any of these functions will opt the whole route into dynamic rendering at request time.\n\n### Streaming\n\n<Image\n  alt=\"Diagram showing parallelization of route segments during streaming, showing data fetching, rendering, and hydration of individual chunks.\"\n  srcLight=\"/docs/light/sequential-parallel-data-fetching.png\"\n  srcDark=\"/docs/dark/sequential-parallel-data-fetching.png\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"525\"\n/>\n\nStreaming enables you to progressively render UI from the server. Work is split into chunks and streamed to the client as it becomes ready. This allows the user to see parts of the page immediately, before the entire content has finished rendering.\n\n<Image\n  alt=\"Diagram showing partially rendered page on the client, with loading UI for chunks that are being streamed.\"\n  srcLight=\"/docs/light/server-rendering-with-streaming.png\"\n  srcDark=\"/docs/dark/server-rendering-with-streaming.png\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"785\"\n/>\n\nStreaming is built into the Next.js App Router by default. This helps improve both the initial page loading performance, as well as UI that depends on slower data fetches that would block rendering the whole route. For example, reviews on a product page.\n\nYou can start streaming route segments using `loading.js` and UI components with [React Suspense](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/loading-ui-and-streaming). See the [Loading UI and Streaming](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/loading-ui-and-streaming) section for more information.\n"},{"path":"docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/03-rendering/03-client-components.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/03-rendering/03-client-components.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/client-components","sha":"93ddc99de102b74c53c83b83c7749fe7181ecad2","size":6066,"content":"---\ntitle: Client Components\ndescription: Learn how to use Client Components to render parts of your application on the client.\n---\n\nClient Components allow you to write interactive UI that is [prerendered on the server](https://github.com/reactwg/server-components/discussions/4) and can use client JavaScript to run in the browser.\n\nThis page will go through how Client Components work, how they're rendered, and when you might use them.\n\n## Benefits of Client Rendering\n\nThere are a couple of benefits to doing the rendering work on the client, including:\n\n- **Interactivity**: Client Components can use state, effects, and event listeners, meaning they can provide immediate feedback to the user and update the UI.\n- **Browser APIs**: Client Components have access to browser APIs, like [geolocation](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API) or [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage).\n\n## Using Client Components in Next.js\n\nTo use Client Components, you can add the React [`\"use client\"` directive](https://react.dev/reference/react/use-client) at the top of a file, above your imports.\n\n`\"use client\"` is used to declare a [boundary](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering#network-boundary) between a Server and Client Component modules. This means that by defining a `\"use client\"` in a file, all other modules imported into it, including child components, are considered part of the client bundle.\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/counter.tsx\" highlight={1} switcher\n'use client'\n\nimport { useState } from 'react'\n\nexport default function Counter() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>\n      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/counter.js\" highlight={1} switcher\n'use client'\n\nimport { useState } from 'react'\n\nexport default function Counter() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>\n      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nThe diagram below shows that using `onClick` and `useState` in a nested component (`toggle.js`) will cause an error if the `\"use client\"` directive is not defined. This is because, by default, all components in the App Router are Server Components where these APIs are not available. By defining the `\"use client\"` directive in `toggle.js`, you can tell React to enter the client boundary where these APIs are available.\n\n<Image\n  alt=\"Use Client Directive and Network Boundary\"\n  srcLight=\"/docs/light/use-client-directive.png\"\n  srcDark=\"/docs/dark/use-client-directive.png\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"1320\"\n/>\n\n> **Defining multiple `use client` entry points**:\n>\n> You can define multiple \"use client\" entry points in your React Component tree. This allows you to split your application into multiple client bundles.\n>\n> However, `\"use client\"` doesn't need to be defined in every component that needs to be rendered on the client. Once you define the boundary, all child components and modules imported into it are considered part of the client bundle.\n\n## How are Client Components Rendered?\n\nIn Next.js, Client Components are rendered differently depending on whether the request is part of a full page load (an initial visit to your application or a page reload triggered by a browser refresh) or a subsequent navigation.\n\n### Full page load\n\nTo optimize the initial page load, Next.js will use React's APIs to render a static HTML preview on the server for both Client and Server Components. This means, when the user first visits your application, they will see the content of the page immediately, without having to wait for the client to download, parse, and execute the Client Component JavaScript bundle.\n\nOn the server:\n\n1. React renders Server Components into a special data format called the [**React Server Component Payload (RSC Payload)**](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components#what-is-the-react-server-component-payload-rsc), which includes references to Client Components.\n2. Next.js uses the RSC Payload and Client Component JavaScript instructions to render **HTML** for the route on the server.\n\nThen, on the client:\n\n1. The HTML is used to immediately show a fast non-interactive initial preview of the route.\n2. The React Server Components Payload is used to reconcile the Client and Server Component trees, and update the DOM.\n3. The JavaScript instructions are used to [hydrate](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/client/hydrateRoot) Client Components and make their UI interactive.\n\n> **What is hydration?**\n>\n> Hydration is the process of attaching event listeners to the DOM, to make the static HTML interactive. Behind the scenes, hydration is done with the [`hydrateRoot`](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/client/hydrateRoot) React API.\n\n### Subsequent Navigations\n\nOn subsequent navigations, Client Components are rendered entirely on the client, without the server-rendered HTML.\n\nThis means the Client Component JavaScript bundle is downloaded and parsed. Once the bundle is ready, React will use the [RSC Payload](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components#what-is-the-react-server-component-payload-rsc) to reconcile the Client and Server Component trees, and update the DOM.\n\n## Going back to the Server Environment\n\nSometimes, after you've declared the `\"use client\"` boundary, you may want to go back to the server environment. For example, you may want to reduce the client bundle size, fetch data on the server, or use an API that is only available on the server.\n\nYou can keep code on the server even though it's theoretically nested inside Client Components by interleaving Client and Server Components and [Server Actions](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions-and-mutations).

This page walks through best practices for fetching data using your preferred method.\n\n## Should I fetch data on the server or the client?\n\nDeciding whether to fetch data on the server or the client depends on the type of UI you're building.\n\nFor most cases, where you don't need real-time data (e.g. polling), you can fetch data on the server with [Server Components](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components). There are a few benefits to doing this:\n\n- You can fetch data in a single server-round trip, reducing the number of network requests and client-server waterfalls.\n- Prevent sensitive information, such as access tokens and API keys, from being exposed to the client (which would require an intermediate API route).\n- Reduce latency by fetching data close to the source (if your application code and database are in the same region).\n- Data requests can be [cached](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/caching-and-revalidating#caching) and [revalidated](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/caching-and-revalidating#revalidating-data).\n\nHowever, server-side data fetching will cause the whole page to be re-rendered on the server. In cases where you need to mutate/revalidate smaller pieces of UI or continually fetch real-time data (e.g. live views), client-side data fetching might be better suited, as it'll allow you to re-render the specific piece of UI on the client.\n\nThere are 4 ways you can fetch data in Next.js:\n\n- [`fetch` API](#fetch-api) on the server.\n- [ORMs or Database Clients](#orms-and-database-clients) on the server.\n- [Route Handlers](#route-handlers) on the server, via the client.\n- [Data Fetching Libraries](#data-fetching-libraries) on the client.\n\n## `fetch` API\n\nNext.js extends the native [`fetch` Web API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) `fetch` to allow you to configure the [caching](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/caching-and-revalidating#fetch-requests) and [revalidating](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/caching-and-revalidating#revalidating-data) behavior for each fetch request on the server. You can use `fetch` in [Server Components](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components), [Route Handlers](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-handlers), and [Server Actions](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions-and-mutations). For example:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/page.tsx\" switcher\nexport default async function Page() {\n  const data = await fetch('https://api.example.com/...').then((res) =>\n    res.json()\n  )\n\n  return <></>\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/page.js\" switcher\nexport default async function Page() {\n  const data = await fetch('https://api.example.com/...').then((res) =>\n    res.json()\n  )\n\n  return <></>\n}\n```\n\nBy default, `fetch` requests retrieve fresh data. Using it will cause a whole route to be [dynamically rendered](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components#dynamic-rendering) and data will not be cached.\n\nYou can cache `fetch` requests by setting the `cache` option to `force-cache`. This means data will be cached, and the component will be [statically rendered](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components#static-rendering-default):\n\n```js\nfetch('https://...', { cache: 'force-cache' })\n```\n\nAlternatively, if using [PPR](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/partial-prerendering), we recommend wrapping components that use `fetch` requests in Suspense boundaries. This will ensure only the component that uses `fetch` is dynamically rendered and streamed in, rather than the entire page:\n\n```tsx filename=\"@/app/ui/cart.tsx switcher\nimport { Suspense } from 'react'\n\n\nexport default async function Cart() {\n  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/...')\n\n  return <></>\n}\n\nexport default function Navigation() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Suspense loading={<LoadingIcon />}>\n        <Cart />\n      </Suspense>\n    <>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nSee the [caching and revalidating](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/caching-and-revalidating) docs for more information.\n\n> **Good to know:** In Next.js 14 and earlier, `fetch` requests were cached by default. See the [upgrade guide](/docs/app/building-your-application/upgrading/version-15) for more information.\n\n### Request Memoization\n\nIf you need to fetch the same data in multiple components in a tree, you do not have to fetch data globally and pass props down. Instead, you can fetch data in the components that need the data without worrying about the performance implications of making multiple requests for the same data.\n\nThis is possible because `fetch` requests with the same URL and options are automatically memoized during a React render pass.\n\nLearn more about [request memoization](/docs/app/building-your-application/caching#request-memoization).\n\n## ORMs and Database Clients\n\nYou can call your ORM or database client in [Server Components](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components), [Route Handlers](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-handlers), and [Server Actions](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions-and-mutations).\n\nYou can use [React `cache`](https://react.dev/reference/react/cache) to memoize data requests during a React render pass. For example, although the `getItem` function is called in both layout and page, only one query will be made to the database:\n\n```ts filename=\"app/utils.ts\" switcher\nimport { cache } from 'react'\n\nexport const getItem = cache(async (id: string) => {\n  const item = await db.item.findUnique({ id })\n  return item\n})\n```\n\n```js filename=\"app/utils.js\" switcher\nimport { cache } from 'react'\n\nexport const getItem = cache(async (id) => {\n  const item = await db.item.findUnique({ id })\n  return item\n})\n```\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/item/[id]/layout.tsx\" switcher\nimport { getItem } from '@/utils/get-item'\n\nexport default async function Layout({\n  params: { id },\n}: {\n  params: { id: string }\n}) {\n  const item = await getItem(id)\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/item/[id]/layout.js\" switcher\nimport { getItem } from '@/utils/get-item'\n\nexport default async function Layout({ params: { id } }) {\n  const item = await getItem(id)\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/item/[id]/page.tsx\" switcher\nimport { getItem } from '@/utils/get-item'\n\nexport default async function Page({\n  params: { id },\n}: {\n  params: { id: string }\n}) {\n  const item = await getItem(id)\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/item/[id]/page.js\" switcher\nimport { getItem } from '@/utils/get-item'\n\nexport default async function Page({ params: { id } }) {\n  const item = await getItem(id)\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\nYou can also configure the caching and revalidating behavior of these requests using the experimental [`unstable_cache`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/unstable_cache) and [`unstable_noStore`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/unstable_noStore) APIs.\n\n## Data Fetching Libraries\n\nYou can fetch data in Client Components using data fetching libraries such as [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/) or [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest). These libraries provide their own APIs for caching, revalidating, and mutating data.\n\nFor example, using SWR to fetch data periodically on the client:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/page.tsx switcher\n\"use client\"\n\nimport useSWR from 'swr'\nimport fetcher from '@/utils/fetcher'\n\nexport default function PollingComponent {\n  // Polling interval set to 2000 milliseconds\n  const { data } = useSWR('/api/data', fetcher, { refreshInterval: 2000 });\n\n  return <></>\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"app/page.tsx\" switcher\n\"use client\"\n\nimport useSWR from 'swr'\nimport fetcher from '@/utils/fetcher'\n\nexport default function PollingComponent {\n  // Polling interval set to 2000 milliseconds\n  const { data } = useSWR('/api/data', fetcher, { refreshInterval: 2000 });\n\n  return <></>\n}\n```\n\n## Route Handlers\n\nIf you need to create API endpoints, Next.js supports [Route Handlers](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-handlers). Route Handlers execute on the server and prevent sensitive information from being exposed to the client (e.g. API credentials).\n\nFor example, using SWR to call a Route Handler:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/ui/message.tsx\" switcher\n'use client'\n\nimport useSWR from 'swr'\nimport fetcher from '@/utils/fetcher'\n\nexport default function Message() {\n  const { data } = useSWR('/api/messages', fetcher)\n\n  return <></>\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/ui/message.js\" switcher\n'use client'\n\nimport useSWR from 'swr'\nimport fetcher from '@/utils/fetcher'\n\nexport default function Message() {\n  const { data } = useSWR('/api/messages', fetcher)\n\n  return <></>\n}\n```\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/api/messages/route.ts\" switcher\nexport async function GET() {\n  const data = await fetch('https://...', {\n    headers: {\n      'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n      'API-Key': process.env.DATA_API_KEY,\n    },\n  }).then((res) => res.json())\n\n  return Response.json({ data })\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"app/api/messages/route.js\" switcher\nexport async function GET() {\n  const data = await fetch('https://...', {\n    headers: {\n      'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n      'API-Key': process.env.DATA_API_KEY,\n    },\n  }).then((res) => res.json())\n\n  return Response.json({ data })\n}\n```\n\nSee the [Route Handler](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-handlers) docs for more examples.\n\n> **Good to know**: Since Server Components render on the server, you don't need to call a Route Handler from a Server Component. You can access your data directly.\n\n## Patterns\n\n### Parallel and sequential data fetching\n\nWhen fetching data inside components, you need to be aware of two data fetching patterns: Parallel and Sequential.\n\n<Image\n  alt=\"Sequential and Parallel Data Fetching\"\n  srcLight=\"/docs/light/sequential-parallel-data-fetching.png\"\n  srcDark=\"/docs/dark/sequential-parallel-data-fetching.png\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"525\"\n/>\n\n- **Sequential**: requests in a component tree are dependent on each other. This can lead to longer loading times.\n- **Parallel**: requests in a route are eagerly initiated and will load data at the same time. This reduces the total time it takes to load data.\n\n#### Sequential data fetching\n\nIf you have nested components, and each component fetches its own data, then data fetching will happen sequentially if those data requests are not [memoized](/docs/app/building-your-application/caching#request-memoization).\n\nThere may be cases where you want this pattern because one fetch depends on the result of the other. For example, the `Playlists` component will only start fetching data once the `Artist` component has finished fetching data because `Playlists` depends on the `artistID` prop:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/artist/[username]/page.tsx\" switcher\nexport default async function Page({\n  params: { username },\n}: {\n  params: { username: string }\n}) {\n  // Get artist information\n  const artist = await getArtist(username)\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h1>{artist.name}</h1>\n      {/* Show fallback UI while the Playlists component is loading */}\n      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>\n        {/* Pass the artist ID to the Playlists component */}\n        <Playlists artistID={artist.id} />\n      </Suspense>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n\nasync function Playlists({ artistID }: { artistID: string }) {\n  // Use the artist ID to fetch playlists\n  const playlists = await getArtistPlaylists(artistID)\n\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {playlists.map((playlist) => (\n        <li key={playlist.id}>{playlist.name}</li>\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/artist/[username]/page.js\" switcher\nexport default async function Page({ params: { username } }) {\n  // Get artist information\n  const artist = await getArtist(username)\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h1>{artist.name}</h1>\n      {/* Show fallback UI while the Playlists component is loading */}\n      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>\n        {/* Pass the artist ID to the Playlists component */}\n        <Playlists artistID={artist.id} />\n      </Suspense>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n\nasync function Playlists({ artistID }) {\n  // Use the artist ID to fetch playlists\n  const playlists = await getArtistPlaylists(artistID)\n\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {playlists.map((playlist) => (\n        <li key={playlist.id}>{playlist.name}</li>\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nYou can use [`loading.js`](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/loading-ui-and-streaming) (for route segments) or [React `<Suspense>`](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/loading-ui-and-streaming#streaming-with-suspense) (for nested components) to show an instant loading state while React streams in the result.\n\nThis will prevent the whole route from being blocked by data requests, and the user will be able to interact with the parts of the page that are ready.\n\n#### Parallel Data Fetching\n\nBy default, layout and page segments are rendered in parallel. This means requests will be initiated in parallel.\n\nHowever, due to the nature of `async`/`await`, an awaited request inside the same segment or component will block any requests below it.\n\nTo fetch data in parallel, you can eagerly initiate requests by defining them outside the components that use the data. This saves time by initiating both requests in parallel, however, the user won't see the rendered result until both promises are resolved.\n\nIn the example below, the `getArtist` and `getAlbums` functions are defined outside the `Page` component and initiated inside the component using `Promise.all`:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/artist/[username]/page.tsx\" switcher\nimport Albums from './albums'\n\nasync function getArtist(username: string) {\n  const res = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/artist/${username}`)\n  return res.json()\n}\n\nasync function getAlbums(username: string) {\n  const res = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/artist/${username}/albums`)\n  return res.json()\n}\n\nexport default async function Page({\n  params: { username },\n}: {\n  params: { username: string }\n}) {\n  const artistData = getArtist(username)\n  const albumsData = getAlbums(username)\n\n  // Initiate both requests in parallel\n  const [artist, albums] = await Promise.all([artistData, albumsData])\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h1>{artist.name}</h1>\n      <Albums list={albums} />\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/artist/[username]/page.js\" switcher\nimport Albums from './albums'\n\nasync function getArtist(username) {\n  const res = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/artist/${username}`)\n  return res.json()\n}\n\nasync function getAlbums(username) {\n  const res = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/artist/${username}/albums`)\n  return res.json()\n}\n\nexport default async function Page({ params: { username } }) {\n  const artistData = getArtist(username)\n  const albumsData = getAlbums(username)\n\n  // Initiate both requests in parallel\n  const [artist, albums] = await Promise.all([artistData, albumsData])\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h1>{artist.name}</h1>\n      <Albums list={albums} />\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nIn addition, you can add a [Suspense Boundary](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/loading-ui-and-streaming) to break up the rendering work and show part of the result as soon as possible.\n\n### Preloading Data\n\nAnother way to prevent waterfalls is to use the _preload_ pattern by creating an utility function that you eagerly call above blocking requests. For example, `checkIsAvailable()` blocks `<Item/>` from rendering, so you can call `preload()` before it to eagerly initiate `<Item/>` data dependencies. By the time `<Item/>` is rendered, its data has already been fetched.\n\nNote that `preload` function doesn't block `checkIsAvailable()` from running.\n\n```tsx filename=\"components/Item.tsx\" switcher\nimport { getItem } from '@/utils/get-item'\n\nexport const preload = (id: string) => {\n  // void evaluates the given expression and returns undefined\n  // https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/void\n  void getItem(id)\n}\nexport default async function Item({ id }: { id: string }) {\n  const result = await getItem(id)\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"components/Item.js\" switcher\nimport { getItem } from '@/utils/get-item'\n\nexport const preload = (id) => {\n  // void evaluates the given expression and returns undefined\n  // https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/void\n  void getItem(id)\n}\nexport default async function Item({ id }) {\n  const result = await getItem(id)\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/item/[id]/page.tsx\" switcher\nimport Item, { preload, checkIsAvailable } from '@/components/Item'\n\nexport default async function Page({\n  params: { id },\n}: {\n  params: { id: string }\n}) {\n  // starting loading item data\n  preload(id)\n  // perform another asynchronous task\n  const isAvailable = await checkIsAvailable()\n\n  return isAvailable ? <Item id={id} /> : null\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/item/[id]/page.js\" switcher\nimport Item, { preload, checkIsAvailable } from '@/components/Item'\n\nexport default async function Page({ params: { id } }) {\n  // starting loading item data\n  preload(id)\n  // perform another asynchronous task\n  const isAvailable = await checkIsAvailable()\n\n  return isAvailable ? <Item id={id} /> : null\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know:** The \"preload\" function can also have any name as it's a pattern, not an API.\n\n#### Using React `cache` and `server-only` with the Preload Pattern\n\nYou can combine the `cache` function, the `preload` pattern, and the `server-only` package to create a data fetching utility that can be used throughout your app.\n\n```ts filename=\"utils/get-item.ts\" switcher\nimport { cache } from 'react'\nimport 'server-only'\n\nexport const preload = (id: string) => {\n  void getItem(id)\n}\n\nexport const getItem = cache(async (id: string) => {\n  // ...\n})\n```\n\n```js filename=\"utils/get-item.js\" switcher\nimport { cache } from 'react'\nimport 'server-only'\n\nexport const preload = (id) => {\n  void getItem(id)\n}\n\nexport const getItem = cache(async (id) => {\n  // ...\n})\n```\n\nWith this approach, you can eagerly fetch data, cache responses, and guarantee that this data fetching [only happens on the server](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/composition-patterns#keeping-server-only-code-out-of-the-client-environment).\n\nThe `utils/get-item` exports can be used by Layouts, Pages, or other components to give them control over when an item's data is fetched.\n\n> **Good to know:**\n>\n> - We recommend using the [`server-only` package](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/composition-patterns#keeping-server-only-code-out-of-the-client-environment) to make sure server data fetching functions are never used on the client.\n\n### Preventing sensitive data from being exposed to the client\n\nWe recommend using React's taint APIs, [`taintObjectReference`](https://react.dev/reference/react/experimental_taintObjectReference) and [`taintUniqueValue`](https://react.dev/reference/react/experimental_taintUniqueValue), to prevent whole object instances or sensitive values from being passed to the client.\n\nTo enable tainting in your application, set the Next.js Config `experimental.taint` option to `true`:\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  experimental: {\n    taint: true,\n  },\n}\n```\n\nThen pass the object or value you want to taint to the `experimental_taintObjectReference` or `experimental_taintUniqueValue` functions:\n\n```ts filename=\"app/utils.ts\" switcher\nimport { queryDataFromDB } from './api'\nimport {\n  experimental_taintObjectReference,\n  experimental_taintUniqueValue,\n} from 'react'\n\nexport async function getUserData() {\n  const data = await queryDataFromDB()\n  experimental_taintObjectReference(\n    'Do not pass the whole user object to the client',\n    data\n  )\n  experimental_taintUniqueValue(\n    \"Do not pass the user's address to the client\",\n    data,\n    data.address\n  )\n  return data\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"app/utils.js\" switcher\nimport { queryDataFromDB } from './api'\nimport {\n  experimental_taintObjectReference,\n  experimental_taintUniqueValue,\n} from 'react'\n\nexport async function getUserData() {\n  const data = await queryDataFromDB()\n  experimental_taintObjectReference(\n    'Do not pass the whole user object to the client',\n    data\n  )\n  experimental_taintUniqueValue(\n    \"Do not pass the user's address to the client\",\n    data,\n    data.address\n  )\n  return data\n}\n```\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/page.tsx\" switcher\nimport { getUserData } from './data'\n\nexport async function Page() {\n  const userData = getUserData()\n  return (\n    <ClientComponent\n      user={userData} // this will cause an error because of taintObjectReference\n      address={userData.address} // this will cause an error because of taintUniqueValue\n    />\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/page.js\" switcher\nimport { getUserData } from './data'\n\nexport async function Page() {\n  const userData = await getUserData()\n  return (\n    <ClientComponent\n      user={userData} // this will cause an error because of taintObjectReference\n      address={userData.address} // this will cause an error because of taintUniqueValue\n    />\n  )\n}\n```\n"},{"path":"docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/02-data-fetching/02-caching-and-revalidating.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/02-data-fetching/02-caching-and-revalidating.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/caching-and-revalidating","sha":"426ed5145833d3c86c673e9e1b191cd4f6e2b3b1","size":7246,"content":"---\ntitle: Caching and Revalidating\nnav_title: Caching and Revalidating\ndescription: Learn how to cache and revalidate data in your Next.js application.\n---\n\n## Caching\n\nCaching is the process of storing data to reduce the number of requests made to the server. Next.js provides a built-in [Data Cache](/docs/app/building-your-application/caching) for individual data requests, giving you granular control of caching behavior.\n\n### `fetch` requests\n\nBy default, `fetch` requests fetch fresh data at runtime.\n\nTo cache an individual `fetch` request, you can use the `cache: 'force-cache'` option:\n\n```js\n// 'force-cache' is the default, and can be omitted\nfetch('https://...', { cache: 'force-cache' })\n```\n\nTo opt out of caching for individual `fetch` requests, you can use the `cache: 'no-store'` option:\n\n```js filename=\"layout.js | page.js\"\nfetch('https://...', { cache: 'no-store' })\n```\n\n> **Advanced**: If you have multiple `fetch` requests in a layout or page segment, you can configure the caching behavior of all data requests in the segment using the `const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` or `const fetchCache = 'force-no-store'` [Segment Config Options](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/route-segment-config).\n\n### Data fetching libraries and ORMs\n\nWhether a data request is cached will depend on the default semantics of your Data Fetching Library, Database Client, or ORM.\n\nTo cache specific requests, you can use the [`unstable_cache`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/unstable_cache) API:\n\n```tsx filename=\"@/app/lib/data.ts switcher highlight={6}\nimport { unstable_cache as cache } from 'next/cache'\n\nexport async function getPosts() {\n  cache()\n\n  try {\n    // Fetch Data\n  } catch (error) {}\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"@/app/lib/data.js switcher highlight={6}\nimport { unstable_cache as cache } from 'next/cache'\n\nexport async function getPosts() {\n  cache()\n  try {\n    // Fetch Data\n  } catch (error) {}\n}\n```\n\nTo opt specific requests out of caching, you can use the [`unstable_noStore`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/unstable_noStore) API:\n\n```tsx filename=\"@/app/lib/data.ts switcher highlight={6}\nimport { unstable_noStore as noStore } from 'next/cache'\n\nexport async function getTransactions() {\n  // Prevent the response from being cached.\n  // This is equivalent to in fetch(..., {cache: 'no-store'}).\n  noStore()\n\n  try {\n    // Fetch Data\n  } catch (error) {}\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"@/app/lib/data.js switcher highlight={6}\nimport { unstable_noStore as noStore } from 'next/cache'\n\nexport async function getTransactions() {\n  // Prevent the response from being cached.\n  // This is equivalent to in fetch(..., {cache: 'no-store'}).\n  noStore()\n\n  try {\n    // Fetch Data\n  } catch (error) {}\n}\n```\n\n## Revalidating data\n\nRevalidation is the process of purging the Data Cache and re-fetching the latest data. This is useful when your data changes and you want to ensure you show the latest information while still benefiting from the speed of static rendering.\n\nCached data can be revalidated in two ways:\n\n- **Time-based revalidation**: Automatically revalidate data after a certain amount of time has passed. This is useful for data that changes infrequently and freshness is not as critical.\n- **On-demand revalidation**: Manually revalidate data based on an event (e.g. form submission). On-demand revalidation can use a tag-based or path-based approach to revalidate groups of data at once. This is useful when you want to ensure the latest data is shown as soon as possible (e.g. when content from your headless CMS is updated).\n\n### Time-based revalidation\n\nTo revalidate data at a timed interval, you can use the `next.revalidate` option of `fetch` to set the cache lifetime of a resource (in seconds).\n\n```js\nfetch('https://...', { next: { revalidate: 3600 } }) // revalidate at most every hour\n```\n\nAlternatively, to revalidate all requests in a route segment, you can use the [Segment Config Options](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/route-segment-config).\n\n```jsx filename=\"layout.js | page.js\"\nexport const revalidate = 3600 // revalidate at most every hour\n```\n\nLearn [how time-based revalidation works](/docs/app/building-your-application/caching#revalidating-1)\n\n> **Good to know:**\n>\n> - If you have multiple fetch requests in a statically rendered route, and each has a different revalidation frequency. The lowest time will be used for all requests.\n> - For dynamically rendered routes, each `fetch` request will be revalidated independently.\n> - To save server resources, we recommend setting a high revalidation time whenever possible. For instance, 1 hour instead of 1 second. If you need real-time data, consider switching to [dynamic rendering](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components#dynamic-rendering) or client-side data fetching.\n\n### On-demand revalidation\n\nData can be revalidated on-demand with the [`revalidatePath`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/revalidatePath) and [`revalidateTag`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/revalidateTag) APIs.\n\nUse `revalidatePath` in [Server Actions](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions-and-mutations) or [Route Handler](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-handlers) to revalidate data for specific routes:\n\n```tsx filename=\"@/app/actions.tsx switcher\nimport { revalidatePath } from 'next/cache'\n\nexport default async createPost() {\n  try {\n    // Mutate data\n    revalidatePath('/posts')\n  } catch(error) {}\n\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"@/app/actions.js switcher\nimport { revalidatePath } from 'next/cache'\n\nexport default async createPost() {\n  try {\n    // Mutate data\n    revalidatePath('/posts')\n  } catch(error) {}\n\n}\n```\n\nUse `revalidateTag` to revalidate `fetch` requests across routes.\n\n1. When using `fetch`, you have the option to tag cache entries with one or more tags.\n2. Then, you can call `revalidateTag` to revalidate all entries associated with that tag.\n\nFor example, the following `fetch` request adds the cache tag `collection`:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/page.tsx\" switcher\nexport default async function Page() {\n  const res = await fetch('https://...', { next: { tags: ['collection'] } })\n  const data = await res.json()\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/page.js\" switcher\nexport default async function Page() {\n  const res = await fetch('https://...', { next: { tags: ['collection'] } })\n  const data = await res.json()\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\nYou can then revalidate this `fetch` call tagged with `collection` by calling `revalidateTag`:\n\n```ts filename=\"@/app/actions.ts\" switcher\n'use server'\n\nimport { revalidateTag } from 'next/cache'\n\nexport default async function action() {\n  revalidateTag('collection')\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"@/app/actions.js\" switcher\n'use server'\n\nimport { revalidateTag } from 'next/cache'\n\nexport default async function action() {\n  revalidateTag('collection')\n}\n```\n\nLearn [how on-demand revalidation works](/docs/app/building-your-application/caching#on-demand-revalidation).\n\n### Error handling and revalidation\n\nIf an error is thrown while attempting to revalidate data, the last successfully generated data will continue to be served from the cache. On the next subsequent request, Next.js will retry revalidating the data.\n"},{"path":"docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/02-data-fetching/index.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/02-data-fetching/index.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching","sha":"498b98c6190566b01b841a006220d0ac4a3bdf69","size":111,"content":"---\ntitle: Data Fetching\ndescription: Learn how to fetch, cache, revalidate, and mutate data with Next.js.\n---\n"},{"path":"docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/02-data-fetching/03-server-actions-and-mutations.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/02-data-fetching/03-server-actions-and-mutations.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions-and-mutations","sha":"fadc17bac0ad0565a8ce1df7b2c1d7167599a589","size":30061,"content":"---\ntitle: Server Actions and Mutations\nnav_title: Server Actions and Mutations\ndescription: Learn how to handle form submissions and data mutations with Next.js.\nrelated:\n  description: Learn how to configure Server Actions in Next.js\n  links:\n    - app/api-reference/next-config-js/serverActions\n---\n\n[Server Actions](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/server-actions) are **asynchronous functions** that are executed on the server. They can be called in Server and Client Components to handle form submissions and data mutations in Next.js applications.\n\n> **🎥 Watch:** Learn more about mutations with Server Actions → [YouTube (10 minutes)](https://youtu.be/dDpZfOQBMaU?si=cJZHlUu_jFhCzHUg).\n\n## Convention\n\nA Server Action can be defined with the React [`\"use server\"`](https://react.dev/reference/react/use-server) directive. You can place the directive at the top of an `async` function to mark the function as a Server Action, or at the top of a separate file to mark all exports of that file as Server Actions.\n\n### Server Components\n\nServer Components can use the inline function level or module level `\"use server\"` directive. To inline a Server Action, add `\"use server\"` to the top of the function body:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/page.tsx\" switcher\nexport default function Page() {\n  // Server Action\n  async function create() {\n    'use server'\n    // Mutate data\n  }\n\n  return <></>\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/page.jsx\" switcher\nexport default function Page() {\n  // Server Action\n  async function create() {\n    'use server'\n    // Mutate data\n  }\n\n  return <></>\n}\n```\n\n### Client Components\n\nTo call a Server Action in a Client Component, create a new file and add the `\"use server\"` directive at the top of it. All functions within the file will be marked as Server Actions that can be reused in both Client and Server Components:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/actions.ts\" switcher\n'use server'\n\nexport async function create() {}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"app/actions.js\" switcher\n'use server'\n\nexport async function create() {}\n```\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/ui/button.tsx\" switcher\n'use client'\n\nimport { create } from '@/app/actions'\n\nexport function Button() {\n  return <Button onClick={create} />\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/ui/button.js\" switcher\n'use client'\n\nimport { create } from '@/app/actions'\n\nexport function Button() {\n  return <Button onClick={create} />\n}\n```\n\n### Passing actions as props\n\nYou can also pass a Server Action to a Client Component as a prop:\n\n```jsx\n<ClientComponent updateItem={updateItem} />\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/client-component.jsx\"\n'use client'\n\nexport default function ClientComponent({ updateItem }) {\n  return <form action={updateItem}>{/* ... */}</form>\n}\n```\n\n## Behavior\n\n- Server actions can be invoked using the `action` attribute in a [`<form>` element](#forms):\n  - Server Components support progressive enhancement by default, meaning the form will be submitted even if JavaScript hasn't loaded yet or is disabled.\n  - In Client Components, forms invoking Server Actions will queue submissions if JavaScript isn't loaded yet, prioritizing client hydration.\n  - After hydration, the browser does not refresh on form submission.\n- Server Actions are not limited to `<form>` and can be invoked from event handlers, `useEffect`, third-party libraries, and other form elements like `<button>`.\n- Server Actions integrate with the Next.js [caching and revalidation](/docs/app/building-your-application/caching) architecture. When an action is invoked, Next.js can return both the updated UI and new data in a single server roundtrip.\n- Behind the scenes, actions use the `POST` method, and only this HTTP method can invoke them.\n- The arguments and return value of Server Actions must be serializable by React. See the React docs for a list of [serializable arguments and values](https://react.dev/reference/react/use-server#serializable-parameters-and-return-values).\n- Server Actions are functions. This means they can be reused anywhere in your application.\n- Server Actions inherit the [runtime](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/edge-and-nodejs-runtimes) from the page or layout they are used on.\n- Server Actions inherit the [Route Segment Config](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/route-segment-config) from the page or layout they are used on, including fields like `maxDuration`.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Forms\n\nReact extends the HTML [`<form>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form) element to allow Server Actions to be invoked with the `action` prop.\n\nWhen invoked in a form, the action automatically receives the [`FormData`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/FormData/FormData) object. You don't need to use React `useState` to manage fields, instead, you can extract the data using the native [`FormData` methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData#instance_methods):\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/invoices/page.tsx\" switcher\nexport default function Page() {\n  async function createInvoice(formData: FormData) {\n    'use server'\n\n    const rawFormData = {\n      customerId: formData.get('customerId'),\n      amount: formData.get('amount'),\n      status: formData.get('status'),\n    }\n\n    // mutate data\n    // revalidate cache\n  }\n\n  return <form action={createInvoice}>...</form>\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/invoices/page.jsx\" switcher\nexport default function Page() {\n  async function createInvoice(formData) {\n    'use server'\n\n    const rawFormData = {\n      customerId: formData.get('customerId'),\n      amount: formData.get('amount'),\n      status: formData.get('status'),\n    }\n\n    // mutate data\n    // revalidate cache\n  }\n\n  return <form action={createInvoice}>...</form>\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know:**\n>\n> - Example: [Form with Loading & Error States](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/next-forms)\n> - When working with forms that have many fields, you may want to consider using the [`entries()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData/entries) method with JavaScript's [`Object.fromEntries()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/fromEntries). For example: `const rawFormData = Object.fromEntries(formData)`. One thing to note is that the `formData` will include additional `$ACTION_` properties.\n> - See [React `<form>` documentation](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/components/form#handle-form-submission-with-a-server-action) to learn more.\n\n### Passing additional arguments\n\nYou can pass additional arguments to a Server Action using the JavaScript `bind` method.\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/client-component.tsx\" highlight={6} switcher\n'use client'\n\nimport { updateUser } from './actions'\n\nexport function UserProfile({ userId }: { userId: string }) {\n  const updateUserWithId = updateUser.bind(null, userId)\n\n  return (\n    <form action={updateUserWithId}>\n      <input type=\"text\" name=\"name\" />\n      <button type=\"submit\">Update User Name</button>\n    </form>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/client-component.js\" highlight={6} switcher\n'use client'\n\nimport { updateUser } from './actions'\n\nexport function UserProfile({ userId }) {\n  const updateUserWithId = updateUser.bind(null, userId)\n\n  return (\n    <form action={updateUserWithId}>\n      <input type=\"text\" name=\"name\" />\n      <button type=\"submit\">Update User Name</button>\n    </form>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nThe Server Action will receive the `userId` argument, in addition to the form data:\n\n```js filename=\"app/actions.js\"\n'use server'\n\nexport async function updateUser(userId, formData) {}\n```\n\n> **Good to know**:\n>\n> - An alternative is to pass arguments as hidden input fields in the form (e.g. `<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"userId\" value={userId} />`). However, the value will be part of the rendered HTML and will not be encoded.\n> - `.bind` works in both Server and Client Components. It also supports progressive enhancement.\n\n### Nested form elements\n\nYou can also invoke a Server Action in elements nested inside `<form>` such as `<button>`, `<input type=\"submit\">`, and `<input type=\"image\">`. These elements accept the `formAction` prop or [event handlers](#event-handlers).\n\nThis is useful in cases where you want to call multiple server actions within a form. For example, you can create a specific `<button>` element for saving a post draft in addition to publishing it. See the [React `<form>` docs](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/components/form#handling-multiple-submission-types) for more information.\n\n### Programmatic form submission\n\nYou can trigger a form submission programmatically using the [`requestSubmit()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLFormElement/requestSubmit) method. For example, when the user submits a form using the `⌘` + `Enter` keyboard shortcut, you can listen for the `onKeyDown` event:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/entry.tsx\" switcher\n'use client'\n\nexport function Entry() {\n  const handleKeyDown = (e: React.KeyboardEvent<HTMLTextAreaElement>) => {\n    if (\n      (e.ctrlKey || e.metaKey) &&\n      (e.key === 'Enter' || e.key === 'NumpadEnter')\n    ) {\n      e.preventDefault()\n      e.currentTarget.form?.requestSubmit()\n    }\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <textarea name=\"entry\" rows={20} required onKeyDown={handleKeyDown} />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/entry.jsx\" switcher\n'use client'\n\nexport function Entry() {\n  const handleKeyDown = (e) => {\n    if (\n      (e.ctrlKey || e.metaKey) &&\n      (e.key === 'Enter' || e.key === 'NumpadEnter')\n    ) {\n      e.preventDefault()\n      e.currentTarget.form?.requestSubmit()\n    }\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <textarea name=\"entry\" rows={20} required onKeyDown={handleKeyDown} />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nThis will trigger the submission of the nearest `<form>` ancestor, which will invoke the Server Action.\n\n### Server-side form validation\n\nWe recommend using HTML validation like `required` and `type=\"email\"` for basic client-side form validation.\n\nFor more advanced server-side validation, you can use a library like [zod](https://zod.dev/) to validate the form fields before mutating the data:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/actions.ts\" switcher\n'use server'\n\nimport { z } from 'zod'\n\nconst schema = z.object({\n  email: z.string({\n    invalid_type_error: 'Invalid Email',\n  }),\n})\n\nexport default async function createUser(formData: FormData) {\n  const validatedFields = schema.safeParse({\n    email: formData.get('email'),\n  })\n\n  // Return early if the form data is invalid\n  if (!validatedFields.success) {\n    return {\n      errors: validatedFields.error.flatten().fieldErrors,\n    }\n  }\n\n  // Mutate data\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/actions.js\" switcher\n'use server'\n\nimport { z } from 'zod'\n\nconst schema = z.object({\n  email: z.string({\n    invalid_type_error: 'Invalid Email',\n  }),\n})\n\nexport default async function createsUser(formData) {\n  const validatedFields = schema.safeParse({\n    email: formData.get('email'),\n  })\n\n  // Return early if the form data is invalid\n  if (!validatedFields.success) {\n    return {\n      errors: validatedFields.error.flatten().fieldErrors,\n    }\n  }\n\n  // Mutate data\n}\n```\n\nOnce the fields have been validated on the server, you can return a serializable object in your action and use the React [`useActionState`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useActionState) hook to show a message to the user.\n\n- By passing the action to `useActionState`, the action's function signature changes to receive a new `prevState` or `initialState` parameter as its first argument.\n- `useActionState` is a React hook and therefore must be used in a Client Component.\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/actions.ts\" switcher\n'use server'\n\nexport async function createUser(prevState: any, formData: FormData) {\n  // ...\n  return {\n    message: 'Please enter a valid email',\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/actions.js\" switcher\n'use server'\n\nexport async function createUser(prevState, formData) {\n  // ...\n  return {\n    message: 'Please enter a valid email',\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThen, you can pass your action to the `useActionState` hook and use the returned `state` to display an error message.\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/ui/signup.tsx\" highlight={11,18-20} switcher\n'use client'\n\nimport { useActionState } from 'react'\nimport { createUser } from '@/app/actions'\n\nconst initialState = {\n  message: '',\n}\n\nexport function Signup() {\n  const [state, formAction] = useActionState(createUser, initialState)\n\n  return (\n    <form action={formAction}>\n      <label htmlFor=\"email\">Email</label>\n      <input type=\"text\" id=\"email\" name=\"email\" required />\n      {/* ... */}\n      <p aria-live=\"polite\" className=\"sr-only\">\n        {state?.message}\n      </p>\n      <button>Sign up</button>\n    </form>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/ui/signup.js\" highlight={11,18-20} switcher\n'use client'\n\nimport { useActionState } from 'react'\nimport { createUser } from '@/app/actions'\n\nconst initialState = {\n  message: '',\n}\n\nexport function Signup() {\n  const [state, formAction] = useActionState(createUser, initialState)\n\n  return (\n    <form action={formAction}>\n      <label htmlFor=\"email\">Email</label>\n      <input type=\"text\" id=\"email\" name=\"email\" required />\n      {/* ... */}\n      <p aria-live=\"polite\" className=\"sr-only\">\n        {state?.message}\n      </p>\n      <button>Sign up</button>\n    </form>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know:**\n>\n> - Before mutating data, you should always ensure a user is also authorized to perform the action. See [Authentication and Authorization](#authentication-and-authorization).\n> - In earlier React Canary versions, this API was part of React DOM and called `useFormState`.\n\n### Pending states\n\nThe [`useActionState`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useActionState) hook exposes a `pending` state that can be used to show a loading indicator while the action is being executed.\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/submit-button.tsx\" highlight={11,21-23} switcher\n'use client'\n\nimport { useActionState } from 'react'\nimport { createUser } from '@/app/actions'\n\nconst initialState = {\n  message: '',\n}\n\nexport function Signup() {\n  const [state, formAction, pending] = useActionState(createUser, initialState)\n\n  return (\n    <form action={formAction}>\n      <label htmlFor=\"email\">Email</label>\n      <input type=\"text\" id=\"email\" name=\"email\" required />\n      {/* ... */}\n      <p aria-live=\"polite\" className=\"sr-only\">\n        {state?.message}\n      </p>\n      <button aria-disabled={pending} type=\"submit\">\n        {pending ? 'Submitting...' : 'Sign up'}\n      </button>\n    </form>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/submit-button.jsx\" highlight={11,21-23} switcher\n'use client'\n\nimport { useActionState } from 'react'\nimport { createUser } from '@/app/actions'\n\nconst initialState = {\n  message: '',\n}\n\nexport function Signup() {\n  const [state, formAction, pending] = useActionState(createUser, initialState)\n\n  return (\n    <form action={formAction}>\n      <label htmlFor=\"email\">Email</label>\n      <input type=\"text\" id=\"email\" name=\"email\" required />\n      {/* ... */}\n      <p aria-live=\"polite\" className=\"sr-only\">\n        {state?.message}\n      </p>\n      <button aria-disabled={pending} type=\"submit\">\n        {pending ? 'Submitting...' : 'Sign up'}\n      </button>\n    </form>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know:** Alternatively, you can also use the [`useFormStatus`](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/hooks/useFormStatus) hook to show a pending state for a specific form.\n\n### Optimistic updates\n\nYou can use the React [`useOptimistic`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useOptimistic) hook to optimistically update the UI before the Server Action finishes executing, rather than waiting for the response:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/page.tsx\" switcher\n'use client'\n\nimport { useOptimistic } from 'react'\nimport { send } from './actions'\n\ntype Message = {\n  message: string\n}\n\nexport function Thread({ messages }: { messages: Message[] }) {\n  const [optimisticMessages, addOptimisticMessage] = useOptimistic<\n    Message[],\n    string\n  >(messages, (state, newMessage) => [...state, { message: newMessage }])\n\n  const formAction = async (formData) => {\n    const message = formData.get('message') as string\n    addOptimisticMessage(message)\n    await send(message)\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      {optimisticMessages.map((m, i) => (\n        <div key={i}>{m.message}</div>\n      ))}\n      <form action={formAction}>\n        <input type=\"text\" name=\"message\" />\n        <button type=\"submit\">Send</button>\n      </form>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/page.jsx\" switcher\n'use client'\n\nimport { useOptimistic } from 'react'\nimport { send } from './actions'\n\nexport function Thread({ messages }) {\n  const [optimisticMessages, addOptimisticMessage] = useOptimistic(\n    messages,\n    (state, newMessage) => [...state, { message: newMessage }]\n  )\n\n  const formAction = async (formData) => {\n    const message = formData.get('message')\n    addOptimisticMessage(message)\n    await send(message)\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      {optimisticMessages.map((m) => (\n        <div>{m.message}</div>\n      ))}\n      <form action={formAction}>\n        <input type=\"text\" name=\"message\" />\n        <button type=\"submit\">Send</button>\n      </form>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### Event handlers\n\nWhile it's common to use Server Actions within `<form>` elements, they can also be invoked with event handlers such as `onClick`. For example, to increment a like count:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/like-button.tsx\" switcher\n'use client'\n\nimport { incrementLike } from './actions'\nimport { useState } from 'react'\n\nexport default function LikeButton({ initialLikes }: { initialLikes: number }) {\n  const [likes, setLikes] = useState(initialLikes)\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <p>Total Likes: {likes}</p>\n      <button\n        onClick={async () => {\n          const updatedLikes = await incrementLike()\n          setLikes(updatedLikes)\n        }}\n      >\n        Like\n      </button>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/like-button.js\" switcher\n'use client'\n\nimport { incrementLike } from './actions'\nimport { useState } from 'react'\n\nexport default function LikeButton({ initialLikes }) {\n  const [likes, setLikes] = useState(initialLikes)\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <p>Total Likes: {likes}</p>\n      <button\n        onClick={async () => {\n          const updatedLikes = await incrementLike()\n          setLikes(updatedLikes)\n        }}\n      >\n        Like\n      </button>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nYou can also add event handlers to form elements, for example, to save a form field `onChange`:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/ui/edit-post.tsx\"\n'use client'\n\nimport { publishPost, saveDraft } from './actions'\n\nexport default function EditPost() {\n  return (\n    <form action={publishPost}>\n      <textarea\n        name=\"content\"\n        onChange={async (e) => {\n          await saveDraft(e.target.value)\n        }}\n      />\n      <button type=\"submit\">Publish</button>\n    </form>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nFor cases like this, where multiple events might be fired in quick succession, we recommend **debouncing** to prevent unnecessary Server Action invocations.\n\n### `useEffect`\n\nYou can use the React [`useEffect`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useEffect) hook to invoke a Server Action when the component mounts or a dependency changes. This is useful for mutations that depend on global events or need to be triggered automatically. For example, `onKeyDown` for app shortcuts, an intersection observer hook for infinite scrolling, or when the component mounts to update a view count:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/view-count.tsx\" switcher\n'use client'\n\nimport { incrementViews } from './actions'\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react'\n\nexport default function ViewCount({ initialViews }: { initialViews: number }) {\n  const [views, setViews] = useState(initialViews)\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const updateViews = async () => {\n      const updatedViews = await incrementViews()\n      setViews(updatedViews)\n    }\n\n    updateViews()\n  }, [])\n\n  return <p>Total Views: {views}</p>\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/view-count.js\" switcher\n'use client'\n\nimport { incrementViews } from './actions'\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react'\n\nexport default function ViewCount({ initialViews }: { initialViews: number }) {\n  const [views, setViews] = useState(initialViews)\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const updateViews = async () => {\n      const updatedViews = await incrementViews()\n      setViews(updatedViews)\n    }\n\n    updateViews()\n  }, [])\n\n  return <p>Total Views: {views}</p>\n}\n```\n\nRemember to consider the [behavior and caveats](https://react.dev/reference/react/useEffect#caveats) of `useEffect`.\n\n### Error Handling\n\nWhen an error is thrown, it'll be caught by the nearest [`error.js`](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/error-handling) or `<Suspense>` boundary on the client. We recommend using `try/catch` to return errors to be handled by your UI.\n\nFor example, your Server Action might handle errors from creating a new item by returning a message:\n\n```ts filename=\"app/actions.ts\" switcher\n'use server'\n\nexport async function createTodo(prevState: any, formData: FormData) {\n  try {\n    // Mutate data\n  } catch (e) {\n    throw new Error('Failed to create task')\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"app/actions.js\" switcher\n'use server'\n\nexport async function createTodo(prevState, formData) {\n  try {\n    //  Mutate data\n  } catch (e) {\n    throw new Error('Failed to create task')\n  }\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know:**\n>\n> - Aside from throwing the error, you can also return an object to be handled by `useActionState`. See [Server-side validation and error handling](#server-side-form-validation).\n\n### Revalidating data\n\nYou can revalidate the [Next.js Cache](/docs/app/building-your-application/caching) inside your Server Actions with the [`revalidatePath`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/revalidatePath) API:\n\n```ts filename=\"app/actions.ts\" switcher\n'use server'\n\nimport { revalidatePath } from 'next/cache'\n\nexport async function createPost() {\n  try {\n    // ...\n  } catch (error) {\n    // ...\n  }\n\n  revalidatePath('/posts')\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"app/actions.js\" switcher\n'use server'\n\nimport { revalidatePath } from 'next/cache'\n\nexport async function createPost() {\n  try {\n    // ...\n  } catch (error) {\n    // ...\n  }\n\n  revalidatePath('/posts')\n}\n```\n\nOr invalidate a specific data fetch with a cache tag using [`revalidateTag`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/revalidateTag):\n\n```ts filename=\"app/actions.ts\" switcher\n'use server'\n\nimport { revalidateTag } from 'next/cache'\n\nexport async function createPost() {\n  try {\n    // ...\n  } catch (error) {\n    // ...\n  }\n\n  revalidateTag('posts')\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"app/actions.js\" switcher\n'use server'\n\nimport { revalidateTag } from 'next/cache'\n\nexport async function createPost() {\n  try {\n    // ...\n  } catch (error) {\n    // ...\n  }\n\n  revalidateTag('posts')\n}\n```\n\n### Redirecting\n\nIf you would like to redirect the user to a different route after the completion of a Server Action, you can use [`redirect`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/redirect) API. `redirect` needs to be called outside of the `try/catch` block:\n\n```ts filename=\"app/actions.ts\" switcher\n'use server'\n\nimport { redirect } from 'next/navigation'\nimport { revalidateTag } from 'next/cache'\n\nexport async function createPost(id: string) {\n  try {\n    // ...\n  } catch (error) {\n    // ...\n  }\n\n  revalidateTag('posts') // Update cached posts\n  redirect(`/post/${id}`) // Navigate to the new post page\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"app/actions.js\" switcher\n'use server'\n\nimport { redirect } from 'next/navigation'\nimport { revalidateTag } from 'next/cache'\n\nexport async function createPost(id) {\n  try {\n    // ...\n  } catch (error) {\n    // ...\n  }\n\n  revalidateTag('posts') // Update cached posts\n  redirect(`/post/${id}`) // Navigate to the new post page\n}\n```\n\n### Cookies\n\nYou can `get`, `set`, and `delete` cookies inside a Server Action using the [`cookies`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/cookies) API:\n\n```ts filename=\"app/actions.ts\" switcher\n'use server'\n\nimport { cookies } from 'next/headers'\n\nexport async function exampleAction() {\n  // Get cookie\n  const value = cookies().get('name')?.value\n\n  // Set cookie\n  cookies().set('name', 'Delba')\n\n  // Delete cookie\n  cookies().delete('name')\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"app/actions.js\" switcher\n'use server'\n\nimport { cookies } from 'next/headers'\n\nexport async function exampleAction() {\n  // Get cookie\n  const value = cookies().get('name')?.value\n\n  // Set cookie\n  cookies().set('name', 'Delba')\n\n  // Delete cookie\n  cookies().delete('name')\n}\n```\n\nSee [additional examples](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/cookies#deleting-cookies) for deleting cookies from Server Actions.\n\n## Security\n\n### Authentication and authorization\n\nYou should treat Server Actions as you would public-facing API endpoints, and ensure that the user is authorized to perform the action. For example:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/actions.ts\"\n'use server'\n\nimport { auth } from './lib'\n\nexport function addItem() {\n  const { user } = auth()\n  if (!user) {\n    throw new Error('You must be signed in to perform this action')\n  }\n\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n### Closures and encryption\n\nDefining a Server Action inside a component creates a [closure](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures) where the action has access to the outer function's scope. For example, the `publish` action has access to the `publishVersion` variable:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/page.tsx\" switcher\nexport default async function Page() {\n  const publishVersion = await getLatestVersion();\n\n  async function publish() {\n    \"use server\";\n    if (publishVersion !== await getLatestVersion()) {\n      throw new Error('The version has changed since pressing publish');\n    }\n    ...\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <form>\n      <button formAction={publish}>Publish</button>\n    </form>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/page.js\" switcher\nexport default async function Page() {\n  const publishVersion = await getLatestVersion();\n\n  async function publish() {\n    \"use server\";\n    if (publishVersion !== await getLatestVersion()) {\n      throw new Error('The version has changed since pressing publish');\n    }\n    ...\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <form>\n      <button formAction={publish}>Publish</button>\n    </form>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nClosures are useful when you need to capture a _snapshot_ of data (e.g. `publishVersion`) at the time of rendering so that it can be used later when the action is invoked.\n\nHowever, for this to happen, the captured variables are sent to the client and back to the server when the action is invoked. To prevent sensitive data from being exposed to the client, Next.js automatically encrypts the closed-over variables. A new private key is generated for each action every time a Next.js application is built. This means actions can only be invoked for a specific build.\n\n> **Good to know:** We don't recommend relying on encryption alone to prevent sensitive values from being exposed on the client. Instead, you should use the [React taint APIs](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/fetching#preventing-sensitive-data-from-being-exposed-to-the-client) to proactively prevent specific data from being sent to the client.\n\n### Overwriting encryption keys (advanced)\n\nWhen self-hosting your Next.js application across multiple servers, each server instance may end up with a different encryption key, leading to potential inconsistencies.\n\nTo mitigate this, you can overwrite the encryption key using the `process.env.NEXT_SERVER_ACTIONS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` environment variable. Specifying this variable ensures that your encryption keys are persistent across builds, and all server instances use the same key.\n\nThis is an advanced use case where consistent encryption behavior across multiple deployments is critical for your application. You should consider standard security practices such key rotation and signing.\n\n> **Good to know:** Next.js applications deployed to Vercel automatically handle this.\n\n### Allowed origins (advanced)\n\nSince Server Actions can be invoked in a `<form>` element, this opens them up to [CSRF attacks](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CSRF).\n\nBehind the scenes, Server Actions use the `POST` method, and only this HTTP method is allowed to invoke them. This prevents most CSRF vulnerabilities in modern browsers, particularly with [SameSite cookies](https://web.dev/articles/samesite-cookies-explained) being the default.\n\nAs an additional protection, Server Actions in Next.js also compare the [Origin header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Origin) to the [Host header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Host) (or `X-Forwarded-Host`). If these don't match, the request will be aborted. In other words, Server Actions can only be invoked on the same host as the page that hosts it.\n\nFor large applications that use reverse proxies or multi-layered backend architectures (where the server API differs from the production domain), it's recommended to use the configuration option [`serverActions.allowedOrigins`](/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/serverActions) option to specify a list of safe origins. The option accepts an array of strings.\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\n/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */\nmodule.exports = {\n  experimental: {\n    serverActions: {\n      allowedOrigins: ['my-proxy.com', '*.my-proxy.com'],\n    },\n  },\n}\n```\n\nLearn more about [Security and Server Actions](https://nextjs.org/blog/security-nextjs-server-components-actions).\n\n## Additional resources\n\nFor more information on Server Actions, check out the following React docs:\n\n- [Server Actions](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/server-actions)\n- [`\"use server\"`](https://react.dev/reference/react/use-server)\n- [`<form>`](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/components/form)\n- [`useFormStatus`](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/hooks/useFormStatus)\n- [`useActionState`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useActionState)\n- [`useOptimistic`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useOptimistic)\n"},{"path":"docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/01-routing/02-pages.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/01-routing/02-pages.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/pages","sha":"121f82a20d240df29cebb2a9563948eae91973f9","size":2219,"content":"---\ntitle: Pages\ndescription: Create your first page in Next.js\nrelated:\n  links:\n    - app/building-your-application/routing/layouts-and-templates\n    - app/building-your-application/routing/linking-and-navigating\n---\n\nA page is UI that is **unique** to a route. You can define a page by default exporting a component from a `page.js` file.\n\nFor example, to create your `index` page, add the `page.js` file inside the `app` directory:\n\n<Image\n  alt=\"page.js special file\"\n  srcLight=\"/docs/light/page-special-file.png\"\n  srcDark=\"/docs/dark/page-special-file.png\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"444\"\n/>\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/page.tsx\" switcher\n// `app/page.tsx` is the UI for the `/` URL\nexport default function Page() {\n  return <h1>Hello, Home page!</h1>\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/page.js\" switcher\n// `app/page.js` is the UI for the `/` URL\nexport default function Page() {\n  return <h1>Hello, Home page!</h1>\n}\n```\n\nThen, to create further pages, create a new folder and add the `page.js` file inside it. For example, to create a page for the `/dashboard` route, create a new folder called `dashboard`, and add the `page.js` file inside it:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/dashboard/page.tsx\" switcher\n// `app/dashboard/page.tsx` is the UI for the `/dashboard` URL\nexport default function Page() {\n  return <h1>Hello, Dashboard Page!</h1>\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/dashboard/page.js\" switcher\n// `app/dashboard/page.js` is the UI for the `/dashboard` URL\nexport default function Page() {\n  return <h1>Hello, Dashboard Page!</h1>\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know**:\n>\n> - The `.js`, `.jsx`, or `.tsx` file extensions can be used for Pages.\n> - A page is always the [leaf](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing#terminology) of the [route subtree](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing#terminology).\n> - A `page.js` file is required to make a route segment publicly accessible.\n> - Pages are [Server Components](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components) by default, but can be set to a [Client Component](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/client-components).\n> - Pages can fetch data.

This page will guide you through how and when to use these special files.\n\n## Layouts\n\nA layout is UI that is **shared** between multiple routes. On navigation, layouts preserve state, remain interactive, and do not re-render. Layouts can also be [nested](#nesting-layouts).\n\nYou can define a layout by default exporting a React component from a `layout.js` file. The component should accept a `children` prop that will be populated with a child layout (if it exists) or a page during rendering.\n\nFor example, the layout will be shared with the `/dashboard` and `/dashboard/settings` pages:\n\n<Image\n  alt=\"layout.js special file\"\n  srcLight=\"/docs/light/layout-special-file.png\"\n  srcDark=\"/docs/dark/layout-special-file.png\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"606\"\n/>\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/dashboard/layout.tsx\" switcher\nexport default function DashboardLayout({\n  children, // will be a page or nested layout\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <section>\n      {/* Include shared UI here e.g. a header or sidebar */}\n      <nav></nav>\n\n      {children}\n    </section>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/dashboard/layout.js\" switcher\nexport default function DashboardLayout({\n  children, // will be a page or nested layout\n}) {\n  return (\n    <section>\n      {/* Include shared UI here e.g. a header or sidebar */}\n      <nav></nav>\n\n      {children}\n    </section>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### Root Layout (Required)\n\nThe root layout is defined at the top level of the `app` directory and applies to all routes. This layout is **required** and must contain `html` and `body` tags, allowing you to modify the initial HTML returned from the server.\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/layout.tsx\" switcher\nexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <body>\n        {/* Layout UI */}\n        <main>{children}</main>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/layout.js\" switcher\nexport default function RootLayout({ children }) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <body>\n        {/* Layout UI */}\n        <main>{children}</main>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### Nesting Layouts\n\nBy default, layouts in the folder hierarchy are **nested**, which means they wrap child layouts via their `children` prop. You can nest layouts by adding `layout.js` inside specific route segments (folders).\n\nFor example, to create a layout for the `/dashboard` route, add a new `layout.js` file inside the `dashboard` folder:\n\n<Image\n  alt=\"Nested Layout\"\n  srcLight=\"/docs/light/nested-layout.png\"\n  srcDark=\"/docs/dark/nested-layout.png\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"606\"\n/>\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/dashboard/layout.tsx\" switcher\nexport default function DashboardLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return <section>{children}</section>\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/dashboard/layout.js\" switcher\nexport default function DashboardLayout({ children }) {\n  return <section>{children}</section>\n}\n```\n\nIf you were to combine the two layouts above, the root layout (`app/layout.js`) would wrap the dashboard layout (`app/dashboard/layout.js`), which would wrap route segments inside `app/dashboard/*`.\n\nThe two layouts would be nested as such:\n\n<Image\n  alt=\"Nested Layouts\"\n  srcLight=\"/docs/light/nested-layouts-ui.png\"\n  srcDark=\"/docs/dark/nested-layouts-ui.png\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"1026\"\n/>\n\n> **Good to know**:\n>\n> - `.js`, `.jsx`, or `.tsx` file extensions can be used for Layouts.\n> - Only the root layout can contain `<html>` and `<body>` tags.\n> - When a `layout.js` and `page.js` file are defined in the same folder, the layout will wrap the page.\n> - Layouts are [Server Components](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components) by default but can be set to a [Client Component](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/client-components).\n> - Layouts can fetch data. View the [Data Fetching](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching) section for more information.\n> - Passing data between a parent layout and its children is not possible. However, you can fetch the same data in a route more than once, and React will [automatically dedupe the requests](/docs/app/building-your-application/caching#request-memoization) without affecting performance.\n> - Layouts do not have access to `pathname` ([learn more](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/layout)). But imported Client Components can access the pathname using [`usePathname`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-pathname) hook.\n> - Layouts do not have access to the route segments below itself. To access all route segments, you can use [`useSelectedLayoutSegment`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-selected-layout-segment) or [`useSelectedLayoutSegments`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-selected-layout-segments) in a Client Component.\n> - You can use [Route Groups](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-groups) to opt specific route segments in and out of shared layouts.\n> - You can use [Route Groups](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-groups) to create multiple root layouts. See an [example here](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-groups#creating-multiple-root-layouts).\n> - **Migrating from the `pages` directory:** The root layout replaces the [`_app.js`](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/custom-app) and [`_document.js`](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/custom-document) files. [View the migration guide](/docs/app/building-your-application/upgrading/app-router-migration#migrating-_documentjs-and-_appjs).\n\n## Templates\n\nTemplates are similar to layouts in that they wrap a child layout or page. Unlike layouts that persist across routes and maintain state, templates create a new instance for each of their children on navigation. This means that when a user navigates between routes that share a template, a new instance of the child is mounted, DOM elements are recreated, state is **not** preserved in Client Components, and effects are re-synchronized.\n\nThere may be cases where you need those specific behaviors, and templates would be a more suitable option than layouts. For example:\n\n- To resynchronize `useEffect` on navigation.\n- To reset the state of a child Client Components on navigation.\n\nA template can be defined by exporting a default React component from a `template.js` file. The component should accept a `children` prop.\n\n<Image\n  alt=\"template.js special file\"\n  srcLight=\"/docs/light/template-special-file.png\"\n  srcDark=\"/docs/dark/template-special-file.png\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"444\"\n/>\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/template.tsx\" switcher\nexport default function Template({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {\n  return <div>{children}</div>\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/template.js\" switcher\nexport default function Template({ children }) {\n  return <div>{children}</div>\n}\n```\n\nIn terms of nesting, `template.js` is rendered between a layout and its children. Here's a simplified output:\n\n```jsx filename=\"Output\"\n<Layout>\n  {/* Note that the template is given a unique key. */}\n  <Template key={routeParam}>{children}</Template>\n</Layout>\n```\n\n## Examples\n\n### Metadata\n\nYou can modify the `<head>` HTML elements such as `title` and `meta` using the [Metadata APIs](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/metadata).\n\nMetadata can be defined by exporting a [`metadata` object](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-metadata#the-metadata-object) or [`generateMetadata` function](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-metadata#generatemetadata-function) in a [`layout.js`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/layout) or [`page.js`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/page) file.\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/page.tsx\" switcher\nimport type { Metadata } from 'next'\n\nexport const metadata: Metadata = {\n  title: 'Next.js',\n}\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return '...'\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/page.js\" switcher\nexport const metadata = {\n  title: 'Next.js',\n}\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return '...'\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know**: You should **not** manually add `<head>` tags such as `<title>` and `<meta>` to root layouts. Instead, use the [Metadata API](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-metadata) which automatically handles advanced requirements such as streaming and de-duplicating `<head>` elements.\n\nLearn more about available metadata options in the [API reference](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-metadata).\n\n### Active Nav Links\n\nYou can use the [usePathname()](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-pathname) hook to determine if a nav link is active.\n\nSince `usePathname()` is a client hook, you need to extract the nav links into a Client Component, which can be imported into your layout or template:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/ui/nav-links.tsx\" switcher\n'use client'\n\nimport { usePathname } from 'next/navigation'\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n\nexport function NavLinks() {\n  const pathname = usePathname()\n\n  return (\n    <nav>\n      <Link className={`link ${pathname === '/' ? 'active' : ''}`} href=\"/\">\n        Home\n      </Link>\n\n      <Link\n        className={`link ${pathname === '/about' ?

In these cases, simply trying again might resolve the issue.\n\nAn error component can use the `reset()` function to prompt the user to attempt to recover from the error. When executed, the function will try to re-render the Error boundary's contents. If successful, the fallback error component is replaced with the result of the re-render.\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/dashboard/error.tsx\" switcher\n'use client'\n\nexport default function Error({\n  error,\n  reset,\n}: {\n  error: Error & { digest?: string }\n  reset: () => void\n}) {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h2>Something went wrong!</h2>\n      <button onClick={() => reset()}>Try again</button>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/dashboard/error.js\" switcher\n'use client'\n\nexport default function Error({ error, reset }) {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h2>Something went wrong!</h2>\n      <button onClick={() => reset()}>Try again</button>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### Nested Routes\n\nReact components created through [special files](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing#file-conventions) are rendered in a [specific nested hierarchy](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing#component-hierarchy).\n\nFor example, a nested route with two segments that both include `layout.js` and `error.js` files are rendered in the following _simplified_ component hierarchy:\n\n<Image\n  alt=\"Nested Error Component Hierarchy\"\n  srcLight=\"/docs/light/nested-error-component-hierarchy.png\"\n  srcDark=\"/docs/dark/nested-error-component-hierarchy.png\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"687\"\n/>\n\nThe nested component hierarchy has implications for the behavior of `error.js` files across a nested route:\n\n- Errors bubble up to the nearest parent error boundary. This means an `error.js` file will handle errors for all its nested child segments. More or less granular error UI can be achieved by placing `error.js` files at different levels in the nested folders of a route.\n- An `error.js` boundary will **not** handle errors thrown in a `layout.js` component in the **same** segment because the error boundary is nested **inside** that layout's component.\n\n### Handling Errors in Layouts\n\n`error.js` boundaries do **not** catch errors thrown in `layout.js` or `template.js` components of the **same segment**. This [intentional hierarchy](#nested-routes) keeps important UI that is shared between sibling routes (such as navigation) visible and functional when an error occurs.\n\nTo handle errors within a specific layout or template, place an `error.js` file in the layout's parent segment.\n\nTo handle errors within the root layout or template, use a variation of `error.js` called `global-error.js`.\n\n### Handling Errors in Root Layouts\n\nThe root `app/error.js` boundary does **not** catch errors thrown in the root `app/layout.js` or `app/template.js` component.\n\nTo specifically handle errors in these root components, use a variation of `error.js` called `app/global-error.js` located in the root `app` directory.\n\nUnlike the root `error.js`, the `global-error.js` error boundary wraps the **entire** application, and its fallback component replaces the root layout when active. Because of this, it is important to note that `global-error.js` **must** define its own `<html>` and `<body>` tags.\n\n`global-error.js` is the least granular error UI and can be considered \"catch-all\" error handling for the whole application. It is unlikely to be triggered often as root components are typically less dynamic, and other `error.js` boundaries will catch most errors.\n\nEven if a `global-error.js` is defined, it is still recommended to define a root `error.js` whose fallback component will be rendered **within** the root layout, which includes globally shared UI and branding.\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/global-error.tsx\" switcher\n'use client'\n\nexport default function GlobalError({\n  error,\n  reset,\n}: {\n  error: Error & { digest?: string }\n  reset: () => void\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html>\n      <body>\n        <h2>Something went wrong!</h2>\n        <button onClick={() => reset()}>Try again</button>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/global-error.js\" switcher\n'use client'\n\nexport default function GlobalError({ error, reset }) {\n  return (\n    <html>\n      <body>\n        <h2>Something went wrong!</h2>\n        <button onClick={() => reset()}>Try again</button>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know**:\n>\n> - `global-error.js` is only enabled in production. In development, our error overlay will show instead.\n\n### Handling Server Errors\n\nIf an error is thrown inside a Server Component, Next.js will forward an `Error` object (stripped of sensitive error information in production) to the nearest `error.js` file as the `error` prop.\n\n#### Securing Sensitive Error Information\n\nDuring production, the `Error` object forwarded to the client only includes a generic `message` and `digest` property.\n\nThis is a security precaution to avoid leaking potentially sensitive details included in the error to the client.\n\nThe `message` property contains a generic message about the error and the `digest` property contains an automatically generated hash of the error that can be used to match the corresponding error in server-side logs.\n\nDuring development, the `Error` object forwarded to the client will be serialized and include the `message` of the original error for easier debugging.\n"},{"path":"docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/01-routing/11-parallel-routes.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/01-routing/11-parallel-routes.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/parallel-routes","sha":"d58c55d8eb5b32e84d5a88b78fb8d51ec9296ef2","size":15109,"content":"---\ntitle: Parallel Routes\ndescription: Simultaneously render one or more pages in the same view that can be navigated independently. A pattern for highly dynamic applications.\nrelated:\n  links:\n    - app/api-reference/file-conventions/default\n---\n\nParallel Routes allows you to simultaneously or conditionally render one or more pages within the same layout. They are useful for highly dynamic sections of an app, such as dashboards and feeds on social sites.\n\nFor example, considering a dashboard, you can use parallel routes to simultaneously render the `team` and `analytics` pages:\n\n<Image\n  alt=\"Parallel Routes Diagram\"\n  srcLight=\"/docs/light/parallel-routes.png\"\n  srcDark=\"/docs/dark/parallel-routes.png\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"942\"\n/>\n\n## Slots\n\nParallel routes are created using named **slots**. Slots are defined with the `@folder` convention. For example, the following file structure defines two slots: `@analytics` and `@team`:\n\n<Image\n  alt=\"Parallel Routes File-system Structure\"\n  srcLight=\"/docs/light/parallel-routes-file-system.png\"\n  srcDark=\"/docs/dark/parallel-routes-file-system.png\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"687\"\n/>\n\nSlots are passed as props to the shared parent layout. For the example above, the component in `app/layout.js` now accepts the `@analytics` and `@team` slots props, and can render them in parallel alongside the `children` prop:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/layout.tsx\" switcher\nexport default function Layout({\n  children,\n  team,\n  analytics,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n  analytics: React.ReactNode\n  team: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <>\n      {children}\n      {team}\n      {analytics}\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/layout.js\" switcher\nexport default function Layout({ children, team, analytics }) {\n  return (\n    <>\n      {children}\n      {team}\n      {analytics}\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nHowever, slots are **not** [route segments](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing#route-segments) and do not affect the URL structure. For example, for `/@analytics/views`, the URL will be `/views` since `@analytics` is a slot.\n\n> **Good to know**:\n>\n> - The `children` prop is an implicit slot that does not need to be mapped to a folder. This means `app/page.js` is equivalent to `app/@children/page.js`.\n\n## Active state and navigation\n\nBy default, Next.js keeps track of the active _state_ (or subpage) for each slot. However, the content rendered within a slot will depend on the type of navigation:\n\n- [**Soft Navigation**](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/linking-and-navigating#5-soft-navigation): During client-side navigation, Next.js will perform a [partial render](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/linking-and-navigating#4-partial-rendering), changing the subpage within the slot, while maintaining the other slot's active subpages, even if they don't match the current URL.\n- **Hard Navigation**: After a full-page load (browser refresh), Next.js cannot determine the active state for the slots that don't match the current URL. Instead, it will render a [`default.js`](#defaultjs) file for the unmatched slots, or `404` if `default.js` doesn't exist.\n\n> **Good to know**:\n>\n> - The `404` for unmatched routes helps ensure that you don't accidentally render a parallel route on a page that it was not intended for.\n\n### `default.js`\n\nYou can define a `default.js` file to render as a fallback for unmatched slots during the initial load or full-page reload.\n\nConsider the following folder structure. The `@team` slot has a `/settings` page, but `@analytics` does not.\n\n<Image\n  alt=\"Parallel Routes unmatched routes\"\n  srcLight=\"/docs/light/parallel-routes-unmatched-routes.png\"\n  srcDark=\"/docs/dark/parallel-routes-unmatched-routes.png\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"930\"\n/>\n\nWhen navigating to `/settings`, the `@team` slot will render the `/settings` page while maintaining the currently active page for the `@analytics` slot.\n\nOn refresh, Next.js will render a `default.js` for `@analytics`. If `default.js` doesn't exist, a `404` is rendered instead.\n\nAdditionally, since `children` is an implicit slot, you also need to create a `default.js` file to render a fallback for `children` when Next.js cannot recover the active state of the parent page.\n\n### `useSelectedLayoutSegment(s)`\n\nBoth [`useSelectedLayoutSegment`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-selected-layout-segment) and [`useSelectedLayoutSegments`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-selected-layout-segments) accept a `parallelRoutesKey` parameter, which allows you to read the active route segment within a slot.\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/layout.tsx\" switcher\n'use client'\n\nimport { useSelectedLayoutSegment } from 'next/navigation'\n\nexport default function Layout({ auth }: { auth: React.ReactNode }) {\n  const loginSegment = useSelectedLayoutSegment('auth')\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/layout.js\" switcher\n'use client'\n\nimport { useSelectedLayoutSegment } from 'next/navigation'\n\nexport default function Layout({ auth }) {\n  const loginSegment = useSelectedLayoutSegment('auth')\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\nWhen a user navigates to `app/@auth/login` (or `/login` in the URL bar), `loginSegment` will be equal to the string `\"login\"`.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Conditional Routes\n\nYou can use Parallel Routes to conditionally render routes based on certain conditions, such as user role. For example, to render a different dashboard page for the `/admin` or `/user` roles:\n\n<Image\n  alt=\"Conditional routes diagram\"\n  srcLight=\"/docs/light/conditional-routes-ui.png\"\n  srcDark=\"/docs/dark/conditional-routes-ui.png\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"898\"\n/>\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/dashboard/layout.tsx\" switcher\nimport { checkUserRole } from '@/lib/auth'\n\nexport default function Layout({\n  user,\n  admin,\n}: {\n  user: React.ReactNode\n  admin: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  const role = checkUserRole()\n  return <>{role === 'admin' ? admin : user}</>\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/dashboard/layout.js\" switcher\nimport { checkUserRole } from '@/lib/auth'\n\nexport default function Layout({ user, admin }) {\n  const role = checkUserRole()\n  return <>{role === 'admin' ? admin : user}</>\n}\n```\n\n### Tab Groups\n\nYou can add a `layout` inside a slot to allow users to navigate the slot independently. This is useful for creating tabs.\n\nFor example, the `@analytics` slot has two subpages: `/page-views` and `/visitors`.\n\n<Image\n  alt=\"Analytics slot with two subpages and a layout\"\n  srcLight=\"/docs/light/parallel-routes-tab-groups.png\"\n  srcDark=\"/docs/dark/parallel-routes-tab-groups.png\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"768\"\n/>\n\nWithin `@analytics`, create a [`layout`](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/layouts-and-templates) file to share the tabs between the two pages:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/@analytics/layout.tsx\" switcher\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n\nexport default function Layout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <nav>\n        <Link href=\"/page-views\">Page Views</Link>\n        <Link href=\"/visitors\">Visitors</Link>\n      </nav>\n      <div>{children}</div>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/@analytics/layout.js\" switcher\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n\nexport default function Layout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <nav>\n        <Link href=\"/page-views\">Page Views</Link>\n        <Link href=\"/visitors\">Visitors</Link>\n      </nav>\n      <div>{children}</div>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### Modals\n\nParallel Routes can be used together with [Intercepting Routes](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/intercepting-routes) to create modals that support deep linking. This allows you to solve common challenges when building modals, such as:\n\n- Making the modal content **shareable through a URL**.\n- **Preserving context** when the page is refreshed, instead of closing the modal.\n- **Closing the modal on backwards navigation** rather than going to the previous route.\n- **Reopening the modal on forwards navigation**.\n\nConsider the following UI pattern, where a user can open a login modal from a layout using client-side navigation, or access a separate `/login` page:\n\n<Image\n  alt=\"Parallel Routes Diagram\"\n  srcLight=\"/docs/light/parallel-routes-auth-modal.png\"\n  srcDark=\"/docs/dark/parallel-routes-auth-modal.png\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"687\"\n/>\n\nTo implement this pattern, start by creating a `/login` route that renders your **main** login page.\n\n<Image\n  alt=\"Parallel Routes Diagram\"\n  srcLight=\"/docs/light/parallel-routes-modal-login-page.png\"\n  srcDark=\"/docs/dark/parallel-routes-modal-login-page.png\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"768\"\n/>\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/login/page.tsx\" switcher\nimport { Login } from '@/app/ui/login'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return <Login />\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/login/page.js\" switcher\nimport { Login } from '@/app/ui/login'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return <Login />\n}\n```\n\nThen, inside the `@auth` slot, add [`default.js`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/default) file that returns `null`. This ensures that the modal is not rendered when it's not active.\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/@auth/default.tsx\" switcher\nexport default function Default() {\n  return null\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/@auth/default.js\" switcher\nexport default function Default() {\n  return null\n}\n```\n\nInside your `@auth` slot, intercept the `/login` route by updating the `/(.)login` folder. Import the `<Modal>` component and its children into the `/(.)login/page.tsx` file:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/@auth/(.)login/page.tsx\" switcher\nimport { Modal } from '@/app/ui/modal'\nimport { Login } from '@/app/ui/login'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <Modal>\n      <Login />\n    </Modal>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/@auth/(.)login/page.js\" switcher\nimport { Modal } from '@/app/ui/modal'\nimport { Login } from '@/app/ui/login'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <Modal>\n      <Login />\n    </Modal>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know:**\n>\n> - The convention used to intercept the route, e.g. `(.)`, depends on your file-system structure. See [Intercepting Routes convention](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/intercepting-routes#convention).\n> - By separating the `<Modal>` functionality from the modal content (`<Login>`), you can ensure any content inside the modal, e.g. [forms](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions-and-mutations#forms), are Server Components. See [Interleaving Client and Server Components](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/composition-patterns#supported-pattern-passing-server-components-to-client-components-as-props) for more information.\n\n#### Opening the modal\n\nNow, you can leverage the Next.js router to open and close the modal. This ensures the URL is correctly updated when the modal is open, and when navigating backwards and forwards.\n\nTo open the modal, pass the `@auth` slot as a prop to the parent layout and render it alongside the `children` prop.\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/layout.tsx\" switcher\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n\nexport default function Layout({\n  auth,\n  children,\n}: {\n  auth: React.ReactNode\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <nav>\n        <Link href=\"/login\">Open modal</Link>\n      </nav>\n      <div>{auth}</div>\n      <div>{children}</div>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/layout.js\" switcher\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n\nexport default function Layout({ auth, children }) {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <nav>\n        <Link href=\"/login\">Open modal</Link>\n      </nav>\n      <div>{auth}</div>\n      <div>{children}</div>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nWhen the user clicks the `<Link>`, the modal will open instead of navigating to the `/login` page. However, on refresh or initial load, navigating to `/login` will take the user to the main login page.\n\n#### Closing the modal\n\nYou can close the modal by calling `router.back()` or by using the `Link` component.\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/ui/modal.tsx\" switcher\n'use client'\n\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/navigation'\n\nexport function Modal({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {\n  const router = useRouter()\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <button\n        onClick={() => {\n          router.back()\n        }}\n      >\n        Close modal\n      </button>\n      <div>{children}</div>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/ui/modal.js\" switcher\n'use client'\n\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/navigation'\n\nexport function Modal({ children }) {\n  const router = useRouter()\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <button\n        onClick={() => {\n          router.back()\n        }}\n      >\n        Close modal\n      </button>\n      <div>{children}</div>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nWhen using the `Link` component to navigate away from a page that shouldn't render the `@auth` slot anymore, we need to make sure the parallel route matches to a component that returns `null`. For example, when navigating back to the root page, we create a `@auth/page.tsx` component:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/ui/modal.tsx\" switcher\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n\nexport function Modal({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Link href=\"/\">Close modal</Link>\n      <div>{children}</div>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/ui/modal.js\" switcher\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n\nexport function Modal({ children }) {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Link href=\"/\">Close modal</Link>\n      <div>{children}</div>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/@auth/page.tsx\" switcher\nexport default function Page() {\n  return null\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/@auth/page.js\" switcher\nexport default function Page() {\n  return null\n}\n```\n\nOr if navigating to any other page (such as `/foo`, `/foo/bar`, etc), you can use a catch-all slot:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/@auth/[...catchAll]/page.tsx\" switcher\nexport default function CatchAll() {\n  return null\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/@auth/[...catchAll]/page.js\" switcher\nexport default function CatchAll() {\n  return null\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know:**\n>\n> - We use a catch-all route in our `@auth` slot to close the modal because of the behavior described in [Active state and navigation](#active-state-and-navigation). Since client-side navigations to a route that no longer match the slot will remain visible, we need to match the slot to a route that returns `null` to close the modal.\n> - Other examples could include opening a photo modal in a gallery while also having a dedicated `/photo/[id]` page, or opening a shopping cart in a side modal.\n> - [View an example](https://github.com/vercel-labs/nextgram) of modals with Intercepted and Parallel Routes.\n\n### Loading and Error UI\n\nParallel Routes can be streamed independently, allowing you to define independent error and loading states for each route:\n\n<Image\n  alt=\"Parallel routes enable custom error and loading states\"\n  srcLight=\"/docs/light/parallel-routes-cinematic-universe.png\"\n  srcDark=\"/docs/dark/parallel-routes-cinematic-universe.png\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"1218\"\n/>\n\nSee the [Loading UI](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/loading-ui-and-streaming) and [Error Handling](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/error-handling) documentation for more information.\n"},{"path":"docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/01-routing/07-redirecting.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/01-routing/07-redirecting.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/redirecting","sha":"36c901d69bc93241ab0c29f43daa50a89295320c","size":22035,"content":"---\ntitle: Redirecting\ndescription: Learn the different ways to handle redirects in Next.js.\nrelated:\n  links:\n    - app/api-reference/functions/redirect\n    - app/api-reference/functions/permanentRedirect\n    - app/building-your-application/routing/middleware\n    - app/api-reference/next-config-js/redirects\n---\n\nThere are a few ways you can handle redirects in Next.js.

You can call `redirect` in [Server Components](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components), [Route Handlers](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-handlers), and [Server Actions](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions-and-mutations).\n\n`redirect` is often used after a mutation or event. For example, creating a post:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/actions.tsx\" switcher\n'use server'\n\nimport { redirect } from 'next/navigation'\nimport { revalidatePath } from 'next/cache'\n\nexport async function createPost(id: string) {\n  try {\n    // Call database\n  } catch (error) {\n    // Handle errors\n  }\n\n  revalidatePath('/posts') // Update cached posts\n  redirect(`/post/${id}`) // Navigate to the new post page\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/actions.js\" switcher\n'use server'\n\nimport { redirect } from 'next/navigation'\nimport { revalidatePath } from 'next/cache'\n\nexport async function createPost(id) {\n  try {\n    // Call database\n  } catch (error) {\n    // Handle errors\n  }\n\n  revalidatePath('/posts') // Update cached posts\n  redirect(`/post/${id}`) // Navigate to the new post page\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know**:\n>\n> - `redirect` returns a 307 (Temporary Redirect) status code by default. When used in a Server Action, it returns a 303 (See Other), which is commonly used for redirecting to a success page as a result of a POST request.\n> - `redirect` internally throws an error so it should be called outside of `try/catch` blocks.\n> - `redirect` can be called in Client Components during the rendering process but not in event handlers. You can use the [`useRouter` hook](#userouter-hook) instead.\n> - `redirect` also accepts absolute URLs and can be used to redirect to external links.\n> - If you'd like to redirect before the render process, use [`next.config.js`](#redirects-in-nextconfigjs) or [Middleware](#nextresponseredirect-in-middleware).\n\nSee the [`redirect` API reference](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/redirect) for more information.\n\n## `permanentRedirect` function\n\nThe `permanentRedirect` function allows you to **permanently** redirect the user to another URL. You can call `permanentRedirect` in [Server Components](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components), [Route Handlers](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-handlers), and [Server Actions](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions-and-mutations).\n\n`permanentRedirect` is often used after a mutation or event that changes an entity's canonical URL, such as updating a user's profile URL after they change their username:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/actions.ts\" switcher\n'use server'\n\nimport { permanentRedirect } from 'next/navigation'\nimport { revalidateTag } from 'next/cache'\n\nexport async function updateUsername(username: string, formData: FormData) {\n  try {\n    // Call database\n  } catch (error) {\n    // Handle errors\n  }\n\n  revalidateTag('username') // Update all references to the username\n  permanentRedirect(`/profile/${username}`) // Navigate to the new user profile\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/actions.js\" switcher\n'use server'\n\nimport { permanentRedirect } from 'next/navigation'\nimport { revalidateTag } from 'next/cache'\n\nexport async function updateUsername(username, formData) {\n  try {\n    // Call database\n  } catch (error) {\n    // Handle errors\n  }\n\n  revalidateTag('username') // Update all references to the username\n  permanentRedirect(`/profile/${username}`) // Navigate to the new user profile\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know**:\n>\n> - `permanentRedirect` returns a 308 (permanent redirect) status code by default.\n> - `permanentRedirect` also accepts absolute URLs and can be used to redirect to external links.\n> - If you'd like to redirect before the render process, use [`next.config.js`](#redirects-in-nextconfigjs) or [Middleware](#nextresponseredirect-in-middleware).\n\nSee the [`permanentRedirect` API reference](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/permanentRedirect) for more information.\n\n</AppOnly>\n\n## `useRouter()` hook\n\n<AppOnly>\n\nIf you need to redirect inside an event handler in a Client Component, you can use the `push` method from the `useRouter` hook. For example:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/page.tsx\" switcher\n'use client'\n\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/navigation'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  const router = useRouter()\n\n  return (\n    <button type=\"button\" onClick={() => router.push('/dashboard')}>\n      Dashboard\n    </button>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/page.js\" switcher\n'use client'\n\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/navigation'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  const router = useRouter()\n\n  return (\n    <button type=\"button\" onClick={() => router.push('/dashboard')}>\n      Dashboard\n    </button>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n</AppOnly>\n\n<PagesOnly>\n\nIf you need to redirect inside a component, you can use the `push` method from the `useRouter` hook. For example:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/page.tsx\" switcher\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/router'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  const router = useRouter()\n\n  return (\n    <button type=\"button\" onClick={() => router.push('/dashboard')}>\n      Dashboard\n    </button>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/page.js\" switcher\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/router'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  const router = useRouter()\n\n  return (\n    <button type=\"button\" onClick={() => router.push('/dashboard')}>\n      Dashboard\n    </button>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n</PagesOnly>\n\n> **Good to know**:\n>\n> - If you don't need to programmatically navigate a user, you should use a [`<Link>`](/docs/app/api-reference/components/link) component.\n\n<AppOnly>\n\nSee the [`useRouter` API reference](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-router) for more information.\n\n</AppOnly>\n\n<PagesOnly>\n\nSee the [`useRouter` API reference](/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/use-router) for more information.\n\n</PagesOnly>\n\n## `redirects` in `next.config.js`\n\nThe `redirects` option in the `next.config.js` file allows you to redirect an incoming request path to a different destination path. This is useful when you change the URL structure of pages or have a list of redirects that are known ahead of time.\n\n`redirects` supports [path](/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/redirects#path-matching), [header, cookie, and query matching](/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/redirects#header-cookie-and-query-matching), giving you the flexibility to redirect users based on an incoming request.\n\nTo use `redirects`, add the option to your `next.config.js` file:\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  async redirects() {\n    return [\n      // Basic redirect\n      {\n        source: '/about',\n        destination: '/',\n        permanent: true,\n      },\n      // Wildcard path matching\n      {\n        source: '/blog/:slug',\n        destination: '/news/:slug',\n        permanent: true,\n      },\n    ]\n  },\n}\n```\n\nSee the [`redirects` API reference](/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/redirects) for more information.\n\n> **Good to know**:\n>\n> - `redirects` can return a 307 (Temporary Redirect) or 308 (Permanent Redirect) status code with the `permanent` option.\n> - `redirects` may have a limit on platforms. For example, on Vercel, there's a limit of 1,024 redirects. To manage a large number of redirects (1000+), consider creating a custom solution using [Middleware](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware). See [managing redirects at scale](#managing-redirects-at-scale-advanced) for more.\n> - `redirects` runs **before** Middleware.\n\n## `NextResponse.redirect` in Middleware\n\nMiddleware allows you to run code before a request is completed. Then, based on the incoming request, redirect to a different URL using `NextResponse.redirect`. This is useful if you want to redirect users based on a condition (e.g. authentication, session management, etc) or have [a large number of redirects](#managing-redirects-at-scale-advanced).\n\nFor example, to redirect the user to a `/login` page if they are not authenticated:\n\n```tsx filename=\"middleware.ts\" switcher\nimport { NextResponse, NextRequest } from 'next/server'\nimport { authenticate } from 'auth-provider'\n\nexport function middleware(request: NextRequest) {\n  const isAuthenticated = authenticate(request)\n\n  // If the user is authenticated, continue as normal\n  if (isAuthenticated) {\n    return NextResponse.next()\n  }\n\n  // Redirect to login page if not authenticated\n  return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', request.url))\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: '/dashboard/:path*',\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"middleware.js\" switcher\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\nimport { authenticate } from 'auth-provider'\n\nexport function middleware(request) {\n  const isAuthenticated = authenticate(request)\n\n  // If the user is authenticated, continue as normal\n  if (isAuthenticated) {\n    return NextResponse.next()\n  }\n\n  // Redirect to login page if not authenticated\n  return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', request.url))\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: '/dashboard/:path*',\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know**:\n>\n> - Middleware runs **after** `redirects` in `next.config.js` and **before** rendering.\n\nSee the [Middleware](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware) documentation for more information.\n\n## Managing redirects at scale (advanced)\n\nTo manage a large number of redirects (1000+), you may consider creating a custom solution using Middleware. This allows you to handle redirects programmatically without having to redeploy your application.\n\nTo do this, you'll need to consider:\n\n1. Creating and storing a redirect map.\n2. Optimizing data lookup performance.\n\n> **Next.js Example**: See our [Middleware with Bloom filter](https://redirects-bloom-filter.vercel.app/) example for an implementation of the recommendations below.\n\n### 1. Creating and storing a redirect map\n\nA redirect map is a list of redirects that you can store in a database (usually a key-value store) or JSON file.\n\nConsider the following data structure:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"/old\": {\n    \"destination\": \"/new\",\n    \"permanent\": true\n  },\n  \"/blog/post-old\": {\n    \"destination\": \"/blog/post-new\",\n    \"permanent\": true\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn [Middleware](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware), you can read from a database such as Vercel's [Edge Config](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/edge-config/get-started?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=next-website) or [Redis](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-kv?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=next-website), and redirect the user based on the incoming request:\n\n```tsx filename=\"middleware.ts\" switcher\nimport { NextResponse, NextRequest } from 'next/server'\nimport { get } from '@vercel/edge-config'\n\ntype RedirectEntry = {\n  destination: string\n  permanent: boolean\n}\n\nexport async function middleware(request: NextRequest) {\n  const pathname = request.nextUrl.pathname\n  const redirectData = await get(pathname)\n\n  if (redirectData && typeof redirectData === 'string') {\n    const redirectEntry: RedirectEntry = JSON.parse(redirectData)\n    const statusCode = redirectEntry.permanent ? 308 : 307\n    return NextResponse.redirect(redirectEntry.destination, statusCode)\n  }\n\n  // No redirect found, continue without redirecting\n  return NextResponse.next()\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"middleware.js\" switcher\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\nimport { get } from '@vercel/edge-config'\n\nexport async function middleware(request) {\n  const pathname = request.nextUrl.pathname\n  const redirectData = await get(pathname)\n\n  if (redirectData) {\n    const redirectEntry = JSON.parse(redirectData)\n    const statusCode = redirectEntry.permanent ? 308 : 307\n    return NextResponse.redirect(redirectEntry.destination, statusCode)\n  }\n\n  // No redirect found, continue without redirecting\n  return NextResponse.next()\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Optimizing data lookup performance\n\nReading a large dataset for every incoming request can be slow and expensive. There are two ways you can optimize data lookup performance:\n\n- Use a database that is optimized for fast reads, such as [Vercel Edge Config](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/edge-config/get-started?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=next-website) or [Redis](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-kv?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=next-website).\n- Use a data lookup strategy such as a [Bloom filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter) to efficiently check if a redirect exists **before** reading the larger redirects file or database.\n\nConsidering the previous example, you can import a generated bloom filter file into Middleware, then, check if the incoming request pathname exists in the bloom filter.\n\nIf it does, forward the request to a <AppOnly>[Route Handler](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-handlers)</AppOnly> <PagesOnly>[API Routes](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes)</PagesOnly> which will check the actual file and redirect the user to the appropriate URL. This avoids importing a large redirects file into Middleware, which can slow down every incoming request.\n\n```tsx filename=\"middleware.ts\" switcher\nimport { NextResponse, NextRequest } from 'next/server'\nimport { ScalableBloomFilter } from 'bloom-filters'\nimport GeneratedBloomFilter from './redirects/bloom-filter.json'\n\ntype RedirectEntry = {\n  destination: string\n  permanent: boolean\n}\n\n// Initialize bloom filter from a generated JSON file\nconst bloomFilter = ScalableBloomFilter.fromJSON(GeneratedBloomFilter as any)\n\nexport async function middleware(request: NextRequest) {\n  // Get the path for the incoming request\n  const pathname = request.nextUrl.pathname\n\n  // Check if the path is in the bloom filter\n  if (bloomFilter.has(pathname)) {\n    // Forward the pathname to the Route Handler\n    const api = new URL(\n      `/api/redirects?pathname=${encodeURIComponent(request.nextUrl.pathname)}`,\n      request.nextUrl.origin\n    )\n\n    try {\n      // Fetch redirect data from the Route Handler\n      const redirectData = await fetch(api)\n\n      if (redirectData.ok) {\n        const redirectEntry: RedirectEntry | undefined =\n          await redirectData.json()\n\n        if (redirectEntry) {\n          // Determine the status code\n          const statusCode = redirectEntry.permanent ? 308 : 307\n\n          // Redirect to the destination\n          return NextResponse.redirect(redirectEntry.destination, statusCode)\n        }\n      }\n    } catch (error) {\n      console.error(error)\n    }\n  }\n\n  // No redirect found, continue the request without redirecting\n  return NextResponse.next()\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"middleware.js\" switcher\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\nimport { ScalableBloomFilter } from 'bloom-filters'\nimport GeneratedBloomFilter from './redirects/bloom-filter.json'\n\n// Initialize bloom filter from a generated JSON file\nconst bloomFilter = ScalableBloomFilter.fromJSON(GeneratedBloomFilter)\n\nexport async function middleware(request) {\n  // Get the path for the incoming request\n  const pathname = request.nextUrl.pathname\n\n  // Check if the path is in the bloom filter\n  if (bloomFilter.has(pathname)) {\n    // Forward the pathname to the Route Handler\n    const api = new URL(\n      `/api/redirects?pathname=${encodeURIComponent(request.nextUrl.pathname)}`,\n      request.nextUrl.origin\n    )\n\n    try {\n      // Fetch redirect data from the Route Handler\n      const redirectData = await fetch(api)\n\n      if (redirectData.ok) {\n        const redirectEntry = await redirectData.json()\n\n        if (redirectEntry) {\n          // Determine the status code\n          const statusCode = redirectEntry.permanent ? 308 : 307\n\n          // Redirect to the destination\n          return NextResponse.redirect(redirectEntry.destination, statusCode)\n        }\n      }\n    } catch (error) {\n      console.error(error)\n    }\n  }\n\n  // No redirect found, continue the request without redirecting\n  return NextResponse.next()\n}\n```\n\n<AppOnly>\n\nThen, in the Route Handler:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/redirects/route.ts\" switcher\nimport { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server'\nimport redirects from '@/app/redirects/redirects.json'\n\ntype RedirectEntry = {\n  destination: string\n  permanent: boolean\n}\n\nexport function GET(request: NextRequest) {\n  const pathname = request.nextUrl.searchParams.get('pathname')\n  if (!pathname) {\n    return new Response('Bad Request', { status: 400 })\n  }\n\n  // Get the redirect entry from the redirects.json file\n  const redirect = (redirects as Record<string, RedirectEntry>)[pathname]\n\n  // Account for bloom filter false positives\n  if (!redirect) {\n    return new Response('No redirect', { status: 400 })\n  }\n\n  // Return the redirect entry\n  return NextResponse.json(redirect)\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"app/redirects/route.js\" switcher\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\nimport redirects from '@/app/redirects/redirects.json'\n\nexport function GET(request) {\n  const pathname = request.nextUrl.searchParams.get('pathname')\n  if (!pathname) {\n    return new Response('Bad Request', { status: 400 })\n  }\n\n  // Get the redirect entry from the redirects.json file\n  const redirect = redirects[pathname]\n\n  // Account for bloom filter false positives\n  if (!redirect) {\n    return new Response('No redirect', { status: 400 })\n  }\n\n  // Return the redirect entry\n  return NextResponse.json(redirect)\n}\n```\n\n</AppOnly>\n\n<PagesOnly>\n\nThen, in the API Route:\n\n```tsx filename=\"pages/api/redirects.ts\"

app/building-your-application/configuring/absolute-imports-and-module-aliases\n---\n\nApart from [routing folder and file conventions](/docs/getting-started/project-structure#app-routing-conventions), Next.js is **unopinionated** about how you organize and colocate your project files.\n\nThis page shares default behavior and features you can use to organize your project.\n\n- [Safe colocation by default](#safe-colocation-by-default)\n- [Project organization features](#project-organization-features)\n- [Project organization strategies](#project-organization-strategies)\n\n## Safe colocation by default\n\nIn the `app` directory, [nested folder hierarchy](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing#route-segments) defines route structure.\n\nEach folder represents a route segment that is mapped to a corresponding segment in a URL path.\n\nHowever, even though route structure is defined through folders, a route is **not publicly accessible** until a `page.js` or `route.js` file is added to a route segment.\n\n<Image\n  alt=\"A diagram showing how a route is not publicly accessible until a page.js or route.js file is added to a route segment.\"\n  srcLight=\"/docs/light/project-organization-not-routable.png\"\n  srcDark=\"/docs/dark/project-organization-not-routable.png\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"444\"\n/>\n\nAnd, even when a route is made publicly accessible, only the **content returned** by `page.js` or `route.js` is sent to the client.\n\n<Image\n  alt=\"A diagram showing how page.js and route.js files make routes publicly accessible.\"\n  srcLight=\"/docs/light/project-organization-routable.png\"\n  srcDark=\"/docs/dark/project-organization-routable.png\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"687\"\n/>\n\nThis means that **project files** can be **safely colocated** inside route segments in the `app` directory without accidentally being routable.\n\n<Image\n  alt=\"A diagram showing colocated project files are not routable even when a segment contains a page.js or route.js file.\"\n  srcLight=\"/docs/light/project-organization-colocation.png\"\n  srcDark=\"/docs/dark/project-organization-colocation.png\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"1011\"\n/>\n\n> **Good to know**:\n>\n> - This is different from the `pages` directory, where any file in `pages` is considered a route.\n> - While you **can** colocate your project files in `app` you don't **have** to. If you prefer, you can [keep them outside the `app` directory](#store-project-files-outside-of-app).\n\n## Project organization features\n\nNext.js provides several features to help you organize your project.\n\n### Private Folders\n\nPrivate folders can be created by prefixing a folder with an underscore: `_folderName`\n\nThis indicates the folder is a private implementation detail and should not be considered by the routing system, thereby **opting the folder and all its subfolders** out of routing.\n\n<Image\n  alt=\"An example folder structure using private folders\"\n  srcLight=\"/docs/light/project-organization-private-folders.png\"\n  srcDark=\"/docs/dark/project-organization-private-folders.png\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"849\"\n/>\n\nSince files in the `app` directory can be [safely colocated by default](#safe-colocation-by-default), private folders are not required for colocation. However, they can be useful for:\n\n- Separating UI logic from routing logic.\n- Consistently organizing internal files across a project and the Next.js ecosystem.\n- Sorting and grouping files in code editors.\n- Avoiding potential naming conflicts with future Next.js file conventions.\n\n> **Good to know**\n>\n> - While not a framework convention, you might also consider marking files outside private folders as \"private\" using the same underscore pattern.\n> - You can create URL segments that start with an underscore by prefixing the folder name with `%5F` (the URL-encoded form of an underscore): `%5FfolderName`.\n> - If you don't use private folders, it would be helpful to know Next.js [special file conventions](/docs/getting-started/project-structure#routing-files) to prevent unexpected naming conflicts.\n\n### Route Groups\n\nRoute groups can be created by wrapping a folder in parenthesis: `(folderName)`\n\nThis indicates the folder is for organizational purposes and should **not be included** in the route's URL path.\n\n<Image\n  alt=\"An example folder structure using route groups\"\n  srcLight=\"/docs/light/project-organization-route-groups.png\"\n  srcDark=\"/docs/dark/project-organization-route-groups.png\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"849\"\n/>\n\nRoute groups are useful for:\n\n- [Organizing routes into groups](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-groups#organize-routes-without-affecting-the-url-path) e.g. by site section, intent, or team.\n- Enabling nested layouts in the same route segment level:\n  - [Creating multiple nested layouts in the same segment, including multiple root layouts](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-groups#creating-multiple-root-layouts)\n  - [Adding a layout to a subset of routes in a common segment](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-groups#opting-specific-segments-into-a-layout)\n\n### `src` Directory\n\nNext.js supports storing application code (including `app`) inside an optional [`src` directory](/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/src-directory). This separates application code from project configuration files which mostly live in the root of a project.\n\n<Image\n  alt=\"An example folder structure with the `src` directory\"\n  srcLight=\"/docs/light/project-organization-src-directory.png\"\n  srcDark=\"/docs/dark/project-organization-src-directory.png\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"687\"\n/>\n\n### Module Path Aliases\n\nNext.js supports [Module Path Aliases](/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/absolute-imports-and-module-aliases) which make it easier to read and maintain imports across deeply nested project files.\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/dashboard/settings/analytics/page.js\"\n// before\nimport { Button } from '../../../components/button'\n\n// after\nimport { Button } from '@/components/button'\n```\n\n## Project organization strategies\n\nThere is no \"right\" or \"wrong\" way when it comes to organizing your own files and folders in a Next.js project.\n\nThe following section lists a very high-level overview of common strategies. The simplest takeaway is to choose a strategy that works for you and your team and be consistent across the project.\n\n> **Good to know**: In our examples below, we're using `components` and `lib` folders as generalized placeholders, their naming has no special framework significance and your projects might use other folders like `ui`, `utils`, `hooks`, `styles`, etc.\n\n### Store project files outside of `app`\n\nThis strategy stores all application code in shared folders in the **root of your project** and keeps the `app` directory purely for routing purposes.\n\n<Image\n  alt=\"An example folder structure with project files outside of app\"\n  srcLight=\"/docs/light/project-organization-project-root.png\"\n  srcDark=\"/docs/dark/project-organization-project-root.png\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"849\"\n/>\n\n### Store project files in top-level folders inside of `app`\n\nThis strategy stores all application code in shared folders in the **root of the `app` directory**.\n\n<Image\n  alt=\"An example folder structure with project files inside app\"\n  srcLight=\"/docs/light/project-organization-app-root.png\"\n  srcDark=\"/docs/dark/project-organization-app-root.png\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"849\"\n/>\n\n### Split project files by feature or route\n\nThis strategy stores globally shared application code in the root `app` directory and **splits** more specific application code into the route segments that use them.\n\n<Image\n  alt=\"An example folder structure with project files split by feature or route\"\n  srcLight=\"/docs/light/project-organization-app-root-split.png\"\n  srcDark=\"/docs/dark/project-organization-app-root-split.png\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"1011\"\n/>\n"},{"path":"docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/01-routing/08-route-groups.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/01-routing/08-route-groups.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-groups","sha":"7035d9fee409fb33f2a006854cf8dab09409364c","size":4018,"content":"---\ntitle: Route Groups\ndescription: Route Groups can be used to partition your Next.js application into different sections.\n---\n\nIn the `app` directory, nested folders are normally mapped to URL paths. However, you can mark a folder as a **Route Group** to prevent the folder from being included in the route's URL path.\n\nThis allows you to organize your route segments and project files into logical groups without affecting the URL path structure.\n\nRoute groups are useful for:\n\n- [Organizing routes into groups](#organize-routes-without-affecting-the-url-path) e.g. by site section, intent, or team.\n- Enabling [nested layouts](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/layouts-and-templates) in the same route segment level:\n  - [Creating multiple nested layouts in the same segment, including multiple root layouts](#creating-multiple-root-layouts)\n  - [Adding a layout to a subset of routes in a common segment](#opting-specific-segments-into-a-layout)\n\n## Convention\n\nA route group can be created by wrapping a folder's name in parenthesis: `(folderName)`\n\n## Examples\n\n### Organize routes without affecting the URL path\n\nTo organize routes without affecting the URL, create a group to keep related routes together. The folders in parenthesis will be omitted from the URL (e.g. `(marketing)` or `(shop)`.\n\n<Image\n  alt=\"Organizing Routes with Route Groups\"\n  srcLight=\"/docs/light/route-group-organisation.png\"\n  srcDark=\"/docs/dark/route-group-organisation.png\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"930\"\n/>\n\nEven though routes inside `(marketing)` and `(shop)` share the same URL hierarchy, you can create a different layout for each group by adding a `layout.js` file inside their folders.\n\n<Image\n  alt=\"Route Groups with Multiple Layouts\"\n  srcLight=\"/docs/light/route-group-multiple-layouts.png\"\n  srcDark=\"/docs/dark/route-group-multiple-layouts.png\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"768\"\n/>\n\n### Opting specific segments into a layout\n\nTo opt specific routes into a layout, create a new route group (e.g. `(shop)`) and move the routes that share the same layout into the group (e.g. `account` and `cart`). The routes outside of the group will not share the layout (e.g. `checkout`).\n\n<Image\n  alt=\"Route Groups with Opt-in Layouts\"\n  srcLight=\"/docs/light/route-group-opt-in-layouts.png\"\n  srcDark=\"/docs/dark/route-group-opt-in-layouts.png\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"930\"\n/>\n\n### Creating multiple root layouts\n\nTo create multiple [root layouts](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/layouts-and-templates#root-layout-required), remove the top-level `layout.js` file, and add a `layout.js` file inside each route group. This is useful for partitioning an application into sections that have a completely different UI or experience. The `<html>` and `<body>` tags need to be added to each root layout.\n\n<Image\n  alt=\"Route Groups with Multiple Root Layouts\"\n  srcLight=\"/docs/light/route-group-multiple-root-layouts.png\"\n  srcDark=\"/docs/dark/route-group-multiple-root-layouts.png\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"687\"\n/>\n\nIn the example above, both `(marketing)` and `(shop)` have their own root layout.\n\n---\n\n> **Good to know**:\n>\n> - The naming of route groups has no special significance other than for organization. They do not affect the URL path.\n> - Routes that include a route group **should not** resolve to the same URL path as other routes. For example, since route groups don't affect URL structure, `(marketing)/about/page.js` and `(shop)/about/page.js` would both resolve to `/about` and cause an error.\n> - If you use multiple root layouts without a top-level `layout.js` file, your home `page.js` file should be defined in one of the route groups, For example: `app/(marketing)/page.js`.\n> - Navigating **across multiple root layouts** will cause a **full page load** (as opposed to a client-side navigation). For example, navigating from `/cart` that uses `app/(shop)/layout.js` to `/blog` that uses `app/(marketing)/layout.js` will cause a full page load. This **only** applies to multiple root layouts.\n"},{"path":"docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/01-routing/15-internationalization.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/01-routing/15-internationalization.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/internationalization","sha":"5fc73676e1a2794f549530f761d1a6f46c8d3303","size":5878,"content":"---\ntitle: Internationalization\ndescription: Add support for multiple languages with internationalized routing and localized content.\n---\n\nNext.js enables you to configure the routing and rendering of content to support multiple languages. Making your site adaptive to different locales includes translated content (localization) and internationalized routes.\n\n## Terminology\n\n- **Locale:** An identifier for a set of language and formatting preferences. This usually includes the preferred language of the user and possibly their geographic region.\n  - `en-US`: English as spoken in the United States\n  - `nl-NL`: Dutch as spoken in the Netherlands\n  - `nl`: Dutch, no specific region\n\n## Routing Overview\n\nIt’s recommended to use the user’s language preferences in the browser to select which locale to use. Changing your preferred language will modify the incoming `Accept-Language` header to your application.\n\nFor example, using the following libraries, you can look at an incoming `Request` to determine which locale to select, based on the `Headers`, locales you plan to support, and the default locale.\n\n```js filename=\"middleware.js\"\nimport { match } from '@formatjs/intl-localematcher'\nimport Negotiator from 'negotiator'\n\nlet headers = { 'accept-language': 'en-US,en;q=0.5' }\nlet languages = new Negotiator({ headers }).languages()\nlet locales = ['en-US', 'nl-NL', 'nl']\nlet defaultLocale = 'en-US'\n\nmatch(languages, locales, defaultLocale) // -> 'en-US'\n```\n\nRouting can be internationalized by either the sub-path (`/fr/products`) or domain (`my-site.fr/products`). With this information, you can now redirect the user based on the locale inside [Middleware](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware).\n\n```js filename=\"middleware.js\"\nimport { NextResponse } from \"next/server\";\n\nlet locales = ['en-US', 'nl-NL', 'nl']\n\n// Get the preferred locale, similar to the above or using a library\nfunction getLocale(request) { ... }\n\nexport function middleware(request) {\n  // Check if there is any supported locale in the pathname\n  const { pathname } = request.nextUrl\n  const pathnameHasLocale = locales.some(\n    (locale) => pathname.startsWith(`/${locale}/`) || pathname === `/${locale}`\n  )\n\n  if (pathnameHasLocale) return\n\n  // Redirect if there is no locale\n  const locale = getLocale(request)\n  request.nextUrl.pathname = `/${locale}${pathname}`\n  // e.g. incoming request is /products\n  // The new URL is now /en-US/products\n  return NextResponse.redirect(request.nextUrl)\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: [\n    // Skip all internal paths (_next)\n    '/((?!_next).*)',\n    // Optional: only run on root (/) URL\n    // '/'\n  ],\n}\n```\n\nFinally, ensure all special files inside `app/` are nested under `app/[lang]`. This enables the Next.js router to dynamically handle different locales in the route, and forward the `lang` parameter to every layout and page. For example:\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/[lang]/page.js\"\n// You now have access to the current locale\n// e.g. /en-US/products -> `lang` is \"en-US\"\nexport default async function Page({ params: { lang } }) {\n  return ...\n}\n```\n\nThe root layout can also be nested in the new folder (e.g. `app/[lang]/layout.js`).\n\n## Localization\n\nChanging displayed content based on the user’s preferred locale, or localization, is not something specific to Next.js. The patterns described below would work the same with any web application.\n\nLet’s assume we want to support both English and Dutch content inside our application. We might maintain two different “dictionaries”, which are objects that give us a mapping from some key to a localized string. For example:\n\n```json filename=\"dictionaries/en.json\"\n{\n  \"products\": {\n    \"cart\": \"Add to Cart\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```json filename=\"dictionaries/nl.json\"\n{\n  \"products\": {\n    \"cart\": \"Toevoegen aan Winkelwagen\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWe can then create a `getDictionary` function to load the translations for the requested locale:\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/[lang]/dictionaries.js\"\nimport 'server-only'\n\nconst dictionaries = {\n  en: () => import('./dictionaries/en.json').then((module) => module.default),\n  nl: () => import('./dictionaries/nl.json').then((module) => module.default),\n}\n\nexport const getDictionary = async (locale) => dictionaries[locale]()\n```\n\nGiven the currently selected language, we can fetch the dictionary inside of a layout or page.\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/[lang]/page.js\"\nimport { getDictionary } from './dictionaries'\n\nexport default async function Page({ params: { lang } }) {\n  const dict = await getDictionary(lang) // en\n  return <button>{dict.products.cart}</button> // Add to Cart\n}\n```\n\nBecause all layouts and pages in the `app/` directory default to [Server Components](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components), we do not need to worry about the size of the translation files affecting our client-side JavaScript bundle size. This code will **only run on the server**, and only the resulting HTML will be sent to the browser.\n\n## Static Generation\n\nTo generate static routes for a given set of locales, we can use `generateStaticParams` with any page or layout. This can be global, for example, in the root layout:\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/[lang]/layout.js\"\nexport async function generateStaticParams() {\n  return [{ lang: 'en-US' }, { lang: 'de' }]\n}\n\nexport default function Root({ children, params }) {\n  return (\n    <html lang={params.lang}>\n      <body>{children}</body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n## Resources\n\n- [Minimal i18n routing and translations](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/app-dir-i18n-routing)\n- [`next-intl`](https://next-intl-docs.vercel.app/docs/next-13)\n- [`next-international`](https://github.com/QuiiBz/next-international)\n- [`next-i18n-router`](https://github.com/i18nexus/next-i18n-router)\n- [`paraglide-next`](https://inlang.com/m/osslbuzt/paraglide-next-i18n)\n"},{"path":"docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/01-routing/10-dynamic-routes.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/01-routing/10-dynamic-routes.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes","sha":"65f7ebfcb83d7b9edfdb10e17a52d0a574cae0d2","size":6545,"content":"---\ntitle: Dynamic Routes\ndescription: Dynamic Routes can be used to programmatically generate route segments from dynamic data.\nrelated:\n  title: Next Steps\n  description: For more information on what to do next, we recommend the following sections\n  links:\n    - app/building-your-application/routing/linking-and-navigating\n    - app/api-reference/functions/generate-static-params\n---\n\nWhen you don't know the exact segment names ahead of time and want to create routes from dynamic data, you can use Dynamic Segments that are filled in at request time or [prerendered](#generating-static-params) at build time.\n\n## Convention\n\nA Dynamic Segment can be created by wrapping a folder's name in square brackets: `[folderName]`. For example, `[id]` or `[slug]`.\n\nDynamic Segments are passed as the `params` prop to [`layout`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/layout), [`page`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/page), [`route`](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-handlers), and [`generateMetadata`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-metadata#generatemetadata-function) functions.\n\n## Example\n\nFor example, a blog could include the following route `app/blog/[slug]/page.js` where `[slug]` is the Dynamic Segment for blog posts.\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx\" switcher\nexport default function Page({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }) {\n  return <div>My Post: {params.slug}</div>\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/blog/[slug]/page.js\" switcher\nexport default function Page({ params }) {\n  return <div>My Post: {params.slug}</div>\n}\n```\n\n| Route                     | Example URL | `params`        |\n| ------------------------- | ----------- | --------------- |\n| `app/blog/[slug]/page.js` | `/blog/a`   | `{ slug: 'a' }` |\n| `app/blog/[slug]/page.js` | `/blog/b`   | `{ slug: 'b' }` |\n| `app/blog/[slug]/page.js` | `/blog/c`   | `{ slug: 'c' }` |\n\nSee the [generateStaticParams()](#generating-static-params) page to learn how to generate the params for the segment.\n\n> **Good to know**: Dynamic Segments are equivalent to [Dynamic Routes](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes) in the `pages` directory.\n\n## Generating Static Params\n\nThe `generateStaticParams` function can be used in combination with [dynamic route segments](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes) to [**statically generate**](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components#static-rendering-default) routes at build time instead of on-demand at request time.\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx\" switcher\nexport async function generateStaticParams() {\n  const posts = await fetch('https://.../posts').then((res) => res.json())\n\n  return posts.map((post) => ({\n    slug: post.slug,\n  }))\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/blog/[slug]/page.js\" switcher\nexport async function generateStaticParams() {\n  const posts = await fetch('https://.../posts').then((res) => res.json())\n\n  return posts.map((post) => ({\n    slug: post.slug,\n  }))\n}\n```\n\nThe primary benefit of the `generateStaticParams` function is its smart retrieval of data. If content is fetched within the `generateStaticParams` function using a `fetch` request, the requests are [automatically memoized](/docs/app/building-your-application/caching#request-memoization). This means a `fetch` request with the same arguments across multiple `generateStaticParams`, Layouts, and Pages will only be made once, which decreases build times.\n\nUse the [migration guide](/docs/app/building-your-application/upgrading/app-router-migration#dynamic-paths-getstaticpaths) if you are migrating from the `pages` directory.\n\nSee [`generateStaticParams` server function documentation](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-static-params) for more information and advanced use cases.\n\n## Catch-all Segments\n\nDynamic Segments can be extended to **catch-all** subsequent segments by adding an ellipsis inside the brackets `[...folderName]`.\n\nFor example, `app/shop/[...slug]/page.js` will match `/shop/clothes`, but also `/shop/clothes/tops`, `/shop/clothes/tops/t-shirts`, and so on.\n\n| Route                        | Example URL   | `params`                    |\n| ---------------------------- | ------------- | --------------------------- |\n| `app/shop/[...slug]/page.js` | `/shop/a`     | `{ slug: ['a'] }`           |\n| `app/shop/[...slug]/page.js` | `/shop/a/b`   | `{ slug: ['a', 'b'] }`      |\n| `app/shop/[...slug]/page.js` | `/shop/a/b/c` | `{ slug: ['a', 'b', 'c'] }` |\n\n## Optional Catch-all Segments\n\nCatch-all Segments can be made **optional** by including the parameter in double square brackets: `[[...folderName]]`.\n\nFor example, `app/shop/[[...slug]]/page.js` will **also** match `/shop`, in addition to `/shop/clothes`, `/shop/clothes/tops`, `/shop/clothes/tops/t-shirts`.\n\nThe difference between **catch-all** and **optional catch-all** segments is that with optional, the route without the parameter is also matched (`/shop` in the example above).\n\n| Route                          | Example URL   | `params`                    |\n| ------------------------------ | ------------- | --------------------------- |\n| `app/shop/[[...slug]]/page.js` | `/shop`       | `{}`                        |\n| `app/shop/[[...slug]]/page.js` | `/shop/a`     | `{ slug: ['a'] }`           |\n| `app/shop/[[...slug]]/page.js` | `/shop/a/b`   | `{ slug: ['a', 'b'] }`      |\n| `app/shop/[[...slug]]/page.js` | `/shop/a/b/c` | `{ slug: ['a', 'b', 'c'] }` |\n\n## TypeScript\n\nWhen using TypeScript, you can add types for `params` depending on your configured route segment.\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx\" switcher\nexport default function Page({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }) {\n  return <h1>My Page</h1>\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/blog/[slug]/page.js\" switcher\nexport default function Page({ params }) {\n  return <h1>My Page</h1>\n}\n```\n\n| Route                               | `params` Type Definition                 |\n| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |\n| `app/blog/[slug]/page.js`           | `{ slug: string }`                       |\n| `app/shop/[...slug]/page.js`        | `{ slug: string[] }`                     |\n| `app/shop/[[...slug]]/page.js`      | `{ slug?: string[] }`                    |\n| `app/[categoryId]/[itemId]/page.js` | `{ categoryId: string, itemId: string }` |\n\n> **Good to know**: This may be done automatically by the [TypeScript plugin](/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/typescript#typescript-plugin) in the future.\n"},{"path":"docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/01-routing/04-linking-and-navigating.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/01-routing/04-linking-and-navigating.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/linking-and-navigating","sha":"c666c0151fc0c46ae54498584219caa53db32ba6","size":16113,"content":"---\ntitle: Linking and Navigating\ndescription: Learn how navigation works in Next.js, and how to use the Link Component and `useRouter` hook.\nrelated:\n  links:\n    - app/building-your-application/caching\n    - app/building-your-application/configuring/typescript\n---\n\nThere are four ways to navigate between routes in Next.js:\n\n- Using the [`<Link>` Component](#link-component)\n- Using the [`useRouter` hook](#userouter-hook) ([Client Components](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/client-components))\n- Using the [`redirect` function](#redirect-function) ([Server Components](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components))\n- Using the native [History API](#using-the-native-history-api)\n\nThis page will go through how to use each of these options, and dive deeper into how navigation works.\n\n## `<Link>` Component\n\n`<Link>` is a built-in component that extends the HTML `<a>` tag to provide [prefetching](#2-prefetching) and client-side navigation between routes. It is the primary and recommended way to navigate between routes in Next.js.\n\nYou can use it by importing it from `next/link`, and passing a `href` prop to the component:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/page.tsx\" switcher\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return <Link href=\"/dashboard\">Dashboard</Link>\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/page.js\" switcher\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return <Link href=\"/dashboard\">Dashboard</Link>\n}\n```\n\nThere are other optional props you can pass to `<Link>`. See the [API reference](/docs/app/api-reference/components/link) for more.\n\n### Examples\n\n#### Linking to Dynamic Segments\n\nWhen linking to [dynamic segments](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes), you can use [template literals and interpolation](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals) to generate a list of links. For example, to generate a list of blog posts:\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/blog/PostList.js\"\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n\nexport default function PostList({ posts }) {\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {posts.map((post) => (\n        <li key={post.id}>\n          <Link href={`/blog/${post.slug}`}>{post.title}</Link>\n        </li>\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n#### Checking Active Links\n\nYou can use [`usePathname()`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-pathname) to determine if a link is active. For example, to add a class to the active link, you can check if the current `pathname` matches the `href` of the link:\n\n```tsx filename=\"@/app/ui/nav-links.tsx\" switcher\n'use client'\n\nimport { usePathname } from 'next/navigation'\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n\nexport function Links() {\n  const pathname = usePathname()\n\n  return (\n    <nav>\n      <Link className={`link ${pathname === '/' ? 'active' : ''}`} href=\"/\">\n        Home\n      </Link>\n\n      <Link\n        className={`link ${pathname === '/about' ? 'active' : ''}`}\n        href=\"/about\"\n      >\n        About\n      </Link>\n    </nav>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"@/app/ui/nav-links.tsx\" switcher\n'use client'\n\nimport { usePathname } from 'next/navigation'\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n\nexport function Links() {\n  const pathname = usePathname()\n\n  return (\n    <nav>\n      <Link className={`link ${pathname === '/' ? 'active' : ''}`} href=\"/\">\n        Home\n      </Link>\n\n      <Link\n        className={`link ${pathname === '/about' ? 'active' : ''}`}\n        href=\"/about\"\n      >\n        About\n      </Link>\n    </nav>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n#### Scrolling to an `id`\n\nThe default behavior of the Next.js App Router is to **scroll to the top of a new route or to maintain the scroll position for backwards and forwards navigation.**\n\nIf you'd like to scroll to a specific `id` on navigation, you can append your URL with a `#` hash link or just pass a hash link to the `href` prop. This is possible since `<Link>` renders to an `<a>` element.\n\n```jsx\n<Link href=\"/dashboard#settings\">Settings</Link>\n\n// Output\n<a href=\"/dashboard#settings\">Settings</a>\n```\n\n> **Good to know**:\n>\n> - Next.js will scroll to the [Page](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/pages) if it is not visible in the viewport upon navigation.\n\n#### Disabling scroll restoration\n\nThe default behavior of the Next.js App Router is to **scroll to the top of a new route or to maintain the scroll position for backwards and forwards navigation.** If you'd like to disable this behavior, you can pass `scroll={false}` to the `<Link>` component, or `scroll: false` to `router.push()` or `router.replace()`.\n\n```jsx\n// next/link\n<Link href=\"/dashboard\" scroll={false}>\n  Dashboard\n</Link>\n```\n\n```jsx\n// useRouter\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/navigation'\n\nconst router = useRouter()\n\nrouter.push('/dashboard', { scroll: false })\n```\n\n## `useRouter()` hook\n\nThe `useRouter` hook allows you to programmatically change routes from [Client Components](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/client-components).\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/page.js\"\n'use client'\n\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/navigation'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  const router = useRouter()\n\n  return (\n    <button type=\"button\" onClick={() => router.push('/dashboard')}>\n      Dashboard\n    </button>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nFor a full list of `useRouter` methods, see the [API reference](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-router).\n\n> **Recommendation:** Use the `<Link>` component to navigate between routes unless you have a specific requirement for using `useRouter`.\n\n## `redirect` function\n\nFor [Server Components](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components), use the `redirect` function instead.\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/team/[id]/page.tsx\" switcher\nimport { redirect } from 'next/navigation'\n\nasync function fetchTeam(id: string) {\n  const res = await fetch('https://...')\n  if (!res.ok) return undefined\n  return res.json()\n}\n\nexport default async function Profile({ params }: { params: { id: string } }) {\n  const team = await fetchTeam(params.id)\n  if (!team) {\n    redirect('/login')\n  }\n\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/team/[id]/page.js\" switcher\nimport { redirect } from 'next/navigation'\n\nasync function fetchTeam(id) {\n  const res = await fetch('https://...')\n  if (!res.ok) return undefined\n  return res.json()\n}\n\nexport default async function Profile({ params }) {\n  const team = await fetchTeam(params.id)\n  if (!team) {\n    redirect('/login')\n  }\n\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know**:\n>\n> - `redirect` returns a 307 (Temporary Redirect) status code by default. When used in a Server Action, it returns a 303 (See Other), which is commonly used for redirecting to a success page as a result of a POST request.\n> - `redirect` internally throws an error so it should be called outside of `try/catch` blocks.\n> - `redirect` can be called in Client Components during the rendering process but not in event handlers. You can use the [`useRouter` hook](#userouter-hook) instead.\n> - `redirect` also accepts absolute URLs and can be used to redirect to external links.\n> - If you'd like to redirect before the render process, use [`next.config.js`](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/redirecting#redirects-in-nextconfigjs) or [Middleware](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/redirecting#nextresponseredirect-in-middleware).\n\nSee the [`redirect` API reference](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/redirect) for more information.\n\n## Using the native History API\n\nNext.js allows you to use the native [`window.history.pushState`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History/pushState) and [`window.history.replaceState`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History/replaceState) methods to update the browser's history stack without reloading the page.\n\n`pushState` and `replaceState` calls integrate into the Next.js Router, allowing you to sync with [`usePathname`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-pathname) and [`useSearchParams`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-search-params).\n\n### `window.history.pushState`\n\nUse it to add a new entry to the browser's history stack. The user can navigate back to the previous state. For example, to sort a list of products:\n\n```tsx fileName=\"app/ui/sort-products.tsx\" switcher\n'use client'\n\nimport { useSearchParams } from 'next/navigation'\n\nexport default function SortProducts() {\n  const searchParams = useSearchParams()\n\n  function updateSorting(sortOrder: string) {\n    const params = new URLSearchParams(searchParams.toString())\n    params.set('sort', sortOrder)\n    window.history.pushState(null, '', `?${params.toString()}`)\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <button onClick={() => updateSorting('asc')}>Sort Ascending</button>\n      <button onClick={() => updateSorting('desc')}>Sort Descending</button>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx fileName=\"app/ui/sort-products.js\" switcher\n'use client'\n\nimport { useSearchParams } from 'next/navigation'\n\nexport default function SortProducts() {\n  const searchParams = useSearchParams()\n\n  function updateSorting(sortOrder) {\n    const params = new URLSearchParams(searchParams.toString())\n    params.set('sort', sortOrder)\n    window.history.pushState(null, '', `?${params.toString()}`)\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <button onClick={() => updateSorting('asc')}>Sort Ascending</button>\n      <button onClick={() => updateSorting('desc')}>Sort Descending</button>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### `window.history.replaceState`\n\nUse it to replace the current entry on the browser's history stack. The user is not able to navigate back to the previous state. For example, to switch the application's locale:\n\n```tsx fileName=\"app/ui/locale-switcher.tsx\" switcher\n'use client'\n\nimport { usePathname } from 'next/navigation'\n\nexport function LocaleSwitcher() {\n  const pathname = usePathname()\n\n  function switchLocale(locale: string) {\n    // e.g. '/en/about' or '/fr/contact'\n    const newPath = `/${locale}${pathname}`\n    window.history.replaceState(null, '', newPath)\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <button onClick={() => switchLocale('en')}>English</button>\n      <button onClick={() => switchLocale('fr')}>French</button>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx fileName=\"app/ui/locale-switcher.js\" switcher\n'use client'\n\nimport { usePathname } from 'next/navigation'\n\nexport function LocaleSwitcher() {\n  const pathname = usePathname()\n\n  function switchLocale(locale) {\n    // e.g. '/en/about' or '/fr/contact'\n    const newPath = `/${locale}${pathname}`\n    window.history.replaceState(null, '', newPath)\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <button onClick={() => switchLocale('en')}>English</button>\n      <button onClick={() => switchLocale('fr')}>French</button>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n## How Routing and Navigation Works\n\nThe App Router uses a hybrid approach for routing and navigation. On the server, your application code is automatically [code-split](#1-code-splitting) by route segments. And on the client, Next.js [prefetches](#2-prefetching) and [caches](#3-caching) the route segments. This means, when a user navigates to a new route, the browser doesn't reload the page, and only the route segments that change re-render - improving the navigation experience and performance.\n\n### 1. Code Splitting\n\nCode splitting allows you to split your application code into smaller bundles to be downloaded and executed by the browser. This reduces the amount of data transferred and execution time for each request, leading to improved performance.\n\n[Server Components](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components) allow your application code to be automatically code-split by route segments. This means only the code needed for the current route is loaded on navigation.\n\n### 2. Prefetching\n\nPrefetching is a way to preload a route in the background before the user visits it.\n\nThere are two ways routes are prefetched in Next.js:\n\n- **`<Link>` component**: Routes are automatically prefetched as they become visible in the user's viewport. Prefetching happens when the page first loads or when it comes into view through scrolling.\n- **`router.prefetch()`**: The `useRouter` hook can be used to prefetch routes programmatically.\n\nThe `<Link>`'s default prefetching behavior (i.e. when the `prefetch` prop is left unspecified or set to `null`) is different depending on your usage of [`loading.js`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/loading). Only the shared layout, down the rendered \"tree\" of components until the first `loading.js` file, is prefetched and cached for `30s`. This reduces the cost of fetching an entire dynamic route, and it means you can show an [instant loading state](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/loading-ui-and-streaming#instant-loading-states) for better visual feedback to users.\n\nYou can disable prefetching by setting the `prefetch` prop to `false`. Alternatively, you can prefetch the full page data beyond the loading boundaries by setting the `prefetch` prop to `true`.\n\nSee the [`<Link>` API reference](/docs/app/api-reference/components/link) for more information.\n\n> **Good to know**:\n>\n> - Prefetching is not enabled in development, only in production.\n\n### 3. Caching\n\nNext.js has an **in-memory client-side cache** called the [Router Cache](/docs/app/building-your-application/caching#client-side-router-cache). As users navigate around the app, the React Server Component Payload of [prefetched](#2-prefetching) route segments and visited routes are stored in the cache.\n\nThis means on navigation, the cache is reused as much as possible, instead of making a new request to the server - improving performance by reducing the number of requests and data transferred.\n\nLearn more about how the [Router Cache](/docs/app/building-your-application/caching#client-side-router-cache) works and how to configure it.\n\n### 4. Partial Rendering\n\nPartial rendering means only the route segments that change on navigation re-render on the client, and any shared segments are preserved.\n\nFor example, when navigating between two sibling routes, `/dashboard/settings` and `/dashboard/analytics`, the `settings` and `analytics` pages will be rendered, and the shared `dashboard` layout will be preserved.\n\n<Image\n  alt=\"How partial rendering works\"\n  srcLight=\"/docs/light/partial-rendering.png\"\n  srcDark=\"/docs/dark/partial-rendering.png\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"945\"\n/>\n\nWithout partial rendering, each navigation would cause the full page to re-render on the client. Rendering only the segment that changes reduces the amount of data transferred and execution time, leading to improved performance.\n\n### 5. Soft Navigation\n\nBrowsers perform a \"hard navigation\" when navigating between pages. The Next.js App Router enables \"soft navigation\" between pages, ensuring only the route segments that have changed are re-rendered (partial rendering). This enables client React state to be preserved during navigation.\n\n### 6. Back and Forward Navigation\n\nBy default, Next.js will maintain the scroll position for backwards and forwards navigation, and re-use route segments in the [Router Cache](/docs/app/building-your-application/caching#client-side-router-cache).\n\n### 7. Routing between `pages/` and `app/`\n\nWhen incrementally migrating from `pages/` to `app/`, the Next.js router will automatically handle hard navigation between the two. To detect transitions from `pages/` to `app/`, there is a client router filter that leverages probabilistic checking of app routes, which can occasionally result in false positives. By default, such occurrences should be very rare, as we configure the false positive likelihood to be 0.01%. This likelihood can be customized via the `experimental.clientRouterFilterAllowedRate` option in `next.config.js`. It's important to note that lowering the false positive rate will increase the size of the generated filter in the client bundle.\n\nAlternatively, if you prefer to disable this handling completely and manage the routing between `pages/` and `app/` manually, you can set `experimental.clientRouterFilter` to false in `next.config.js`. When this feature is disabled, any dynamic routes in pages that overlap with app routes won't be navigated to properly by default.\n"},{"path":"docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/01-routing/01-defining-routes.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/01-routing/01-defining-routes.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/defining-routes","sha":"65ec00e329db1c3d8e5187c2ba8bd91b2d94a868","size":2367,"content":"---\ntitle: Defining Routes\ndescription: Learn how to create your first route in Next.js.\nrelated:\n  description: Learn more about creating pages and layouts.\n  links:\n    - app/building-your-application/routing/pages\n---\n\n> We recommend reading the [Routing Fundamentals](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing) page before continuing.\n\nThis page will guide you through how to define and organize routes in your Next.js application.\n\n## Creating Routes\n\nNext.js uses a file-system based router where **folders** are used to define routes.\n\nEach folder represents a [**route** segment](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing#route-segments) that maps to a **URL** segment. To create a [nested route](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing#nested-routes), you can nest folders inside each other.\n\n<Image\n  alt=\"Route segments to path segments\"\n  srcLight=\"/docs/light/route-segments-to-path-segments.png\"\n  srcDark=\"/docs/dark/route-segments-to-path-segments.png\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"594\"\n/>\n\nA special [`page.js` file](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/pages) is used to make route segments publicly accessible.\n\n<Image\n  alt=\"Defining Routes\"\n  srcLight=\"/docs/light/defining-routes.png\"\n  srcDark=\"/docs/dark/defining-routes.png\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"687\"\n/>\n\nIn this example, the `/dashboard/analytics` URL path is _not_ publicly accessible because it does not have a corresponding `page.js` file. This folder could be used to store components, stylesheets, images, or other colocated files.\n\n> **Good to know**: `.js`, `.jsx`, or `.tsx` file extensions can be used for special files.\n\n## Creating UI\n\n[Special file conventions](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing#file-conventions) are used to create UI for each route segment. The most common are [pages](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/pages) to show UI unique to a route, and [layouts](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/layouts-and-templates#layouts) to show UI that is shared across multiple routes.\n\nFor example, to create your first page, add a `page.js` file inside the `app` directory and export a React component:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/page.tsx\" switcher\nexport default function Page() {\n  return <h1>Hello, Next.js!</h1>\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/page.js\" switcher\nexport default function Page() {\n  return <h1>Hello, Next.js!</h1>\n}\n```\n"},{"path":"docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/01-routing/06-loading-ui-and-streaming.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/01-routing/06-loading-ui-and-streaming.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/loading-ui-and-streaming","sha":"867243be7dc8849fbfac4e6ca558091abb1bb99a","size":8855,"content":"---\ntitle: Loading UI and Streaming\ndescription: Built on top of Suspense, Loading UI allows you to create a fallback for specific route segments, and automatically stream content as it becomes ready.\n---\n\nThe special file `loading.js` helps you create meaningful Loading UI with [React Suspense](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense).

The new content is automatically swapped in once rendering is complete.\n\n<Image\n  alt=\"Loading UI\"\n  srcLight=\"/docs/light/loading-ui.png\"\n  srcDark=\"/docs/dark/loading-ui.png\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"691\"\n/>\n\n## Instant Loading States\n\nAn instant loading state is fallback UI that is shown immediately upon navigation. You can pre-render loading indicators such as skeletons and spinners, or a small but meaningful part of future screens such as a cover photo, title, etc. This helps users understand the app is responding and provides a better user experience.\n\nCreate a loading state by adding a `loading.js` file inside a folder.\n\n<Image\n  alt=\"loading.js special file\"\n  srcLight=\"/docs/light/loading-special-file.png\"\n  srcDark=\"/docs/dark/loading-special-file.png\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"606\"\n/>\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/dashboard/loading.tsx\" switcher\nexport default function Loading() {\n  // You can add any UI inside Loading, including a Skeleton.\n  return <LoadingSkeleton />\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/dashboard/loading.js\" switcher\nexport default function Loading() {\n  // You can add any UI inside Loading, including a Skeleton.\n  return <LoadingSkeleton />\n}\n```\n\nIn the same folder, `loading.js` will be nested inside `layout.js`. It will automatically wrap the `page.js` file and any children below in a `<Suspense>` boundary.\n\n<Image\n  alt=\"loading.js overview\"\n  srcLight=\"/docs/light/loading-overview.png\"\n  srcDark=\"/docs/dark/loading-overview.png\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"768\"\n/>\n\n> **Good to know**:\n>\n> - Navigation is immediate, even with [server-centric routing](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/linking-and-navigating#how-routing-and-navigation-works).\n> - Navigation is interruptible, meaning changing routes does not need to wait for the content of the route to fully load before navigating to another route.\n> - Shared layouts remain interactive while new route segments load.\n\n> **Recommendation:** Use the `loading.js` convention for route segments (layouts and pages) as Next.js optimizes this functionality.\n\n## Streaming with Suspense\n\nIn addition to `loading.js`, you can also manually create Suspense Boundaries for your own UI components. The App Router supports streaming with [Suspense](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense) for both [Node.js and Edge runtimes](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/edge-and-nodejs-runtimes).\n\n> **Good to know**:\n>\n> - [Some browsers](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=252413) buffer a streaming response. You may not see the streamed response until the response exceeds 1024 bytes. This typically only affects “hello world” applications, but not real applications.\n\n### What is Streaming?\n\nTo learn how Streaming works in React and Next.js, it's helpful to understand **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** and its limitations.\n\nWith SSR, there's a series of steps that need to be completed before a user can see and interact with a page:\n\n1. First, all data for a given page is fetched on the server.\n2. The server then renders the HTML for the page.\n3. The HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the page are sent to the client.\n4. A non-interactive user interface is shown using the generated HTML, and CSS.\n5. Finally, React [hydrates](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/client/hydrateRoot#hydrating-server-rendered-html) the user interface to make it interactive.\n\n<Image\n  alt=\"Chart showing Server Rendering without Streaming\"\n  srcLight=\"/docs/light/server-rendering-without-streaming-chart.png\"\n  srcDark=\"/docs/dark/server-rendering-without-streaming-chart.png\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"612\"\n/>\n\nThese steps are sequential and blocking, meaning the server can only render the HTML for a page once all the data has been fetched. And, on the client, React can only hydrate the UI once the code for all components in the page has been downloaded.\n\nSSR with React and Next.js helps improve the perceived loading performance by showing a non-interactive page to the user as soon as possible.\n\n<Image\n  alt=\"Server Rendering without Streaming\"\n  srcLight=\"/docs/light/server-rendering-without-streaming.png\"\n  srcDark=\"/docs/dark/server-rendering-without-streaming.png\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"748\"\n/>\n\nHowever, it can still be slow as all data fetching on server needs to be completed before the page can be shown to the user.\n\n**Streaming** allows you to break down the page's HTML into smaller chunks and progressively send those chunks from the server to the client.\n\n<Image\n  alt=\"How Server Rendering with Streaming Works\"\n  srcLight=\"/docs/light/server-rendering-with-streaming.png\"\n  srcDark=\"/docs/dark/server-rendering-with-streaming.png\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"785\"\n/>\n\nThis enables parts of the page to be displayed sooner, without waiting for all the data to load before any UI can be rendered.\n\nStreaming works well with React's component model because each component can be considered a chunk. Components that have higher priority (e.g. product information) or that don't rely on data can be sent first (e.g. layout), and React can start hydration earlier. Components that have lower priority (e.g. reviews, related products) can be sent in the same server request after their data has been fetched.\n\n<Image\n  alt=\"Chart showing Server Rendering with Streaming\"\n  srcLight=\"/docs/light/server-rendering-with-streaming-chart.png\"\n  srcDark=\"/docs/dark/server-rendering-with-streaming-chart.png\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"730\"\n/>\n\nStreaming is particularly beneficial when you want to prevent long data requests from blocking the page from rendering as it can reduce the [Time To First Byte (TTFB)](https://web.dev/ttfb/) and [First Contentful Paint (FCP)](https://web.dev/first-contentful-paint/). It also helps improve [Time to Interactive (TTI)](https://developer.chrome.com/en/docs/lighthouse/performance/interactive/), especially on slower devices.\n\n### Example\n\n`<Suspense>` works by wrapping a component that performs an asynchronous action (e.g. fetch data), showing fallback UI (e.g. skeleton, spinner) while it's happening, and then swapping in your component once the action completes.\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/dashboard/page.tsx\" switcher\nimport { Suspense } from 'react'\nimport { PostFeed, Weather } from './Components'\n\nexport default function Posts() {\n  return (\n    <section>\n      <Suspense fallback={<p>Loading feed...</p>}>\n        <PostFeed />\n      </Suspense>\n      <Suspense fallback={<p>Loading weather...</p>}>\n        <Weather />\n      </Suspense>\n    </section>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/dashboard/page.js\" switcher\nimport { Suspense } from 'react'\nimport { PostFeed, Weather } from './Components'\n\nexport default function Posts() {\n  return (\n    <section>\n      <Suspense fallback={<p>Loading feed...</p>}>\n        <PostFeed />\n      </Suspense>\n      <Suspense fallback={<p>Loading weather...</p>}>\n        <Weather />\n      </Suspense>\n    </section>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nBy using Suspense, you get the benefits of:\n\n1. **Streaming Server Rendering** - Progressively rendering HTML from the server to the client.\n2. **Selective Hydration** - React prioritizes what components to make interactive first based on user interaction.\n\nFor more Suspense examples and use cases, please see the [React Documentation](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense).\n\n### SEO\n\n- Next.js will wait for data fetching inside [`generateMetadata`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-metadata) to complete before streaming UI to the client. This guarantees the first part of a streamed response includes `<head>` tags.\n- Since streaming is server-rendered, it does not impact SEO. You can use the [Rich Results Test](https://search.google.com/test/rich-results) tool from Google to see how your page appears to Google's web crawlers and view the serialized HTML ([source](https://web.dev/rendering-on-the-web/#seo-considerations)).\n\n### Status Codes\n\nWhen streaming, a `200` status code will be returned to signal that the request was successful.\n\nThe server can still communicate errors or issues to the client within the streamed content itself, for example, when using [`redirect`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/redirect) or [`notFound`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/not-found). Since the response headers have already been sent to the client, the status code of the response cannot be updated. This does not affect SEO.\n"},{"path":"docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/01-routing/12-intercepting-routes.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/01-routing/12-intercepting-routes.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/intercepting-routes","sha":"c9cf7ee2af75d6c6e18ca70cf059d1b9d62a8cd8","size":3757,"content":"---\ntitle: Intercepting Routes\ndescription: Use intercepting routes to load a new route within the current layout while masking the browser URL, useful for advanced routing patterns such as modals.\nrelated:\n  title: Next Steps\n  description: Learn how to use modals with Intercepted and Parallel Routes.\n  links:\n    - app/building-your-application/routing/parallel-routes\n---\n\nIntercepting routes allows you to load a route from another part of your application within the current layout. This routing paradigm can be useful when you want to display the content of a route without the user switching to a different context.\n\nFor example, when clicking on a photo in a feed, you can display the photo in a modal, overlaying the feed. In this case, Next.js intercepts the `/photo/123` route, masks the URL, and overlays it over `/feed`.\n\n<Image\n  alt=\"Intercepting routes soft navigation\"\n  srcLight=\"/docs/light/intercepting-routes-soft-navigate.png\"\n  srcDark=\"/docs/dark/intercepting-routes-soft-navigate.png\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"617\"\n/>\n\nHowever, when navigating to the photo by clicking a shareable URL or by refreshing the page, the entire photo page should render instead of the modal. No route interception should occur.\n\n<Image\n  alt=\"Intercepting routes hard navigation\"\n  srcLight=\"/docs/light/intercepting-routes-hard-navigate.png\"\n  srcDark=\"/docs/dark/intercepting-routes-hard-navigate.png\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"604\"\n/>\n\n## Convention\n\nIntercepting routes can be defined with the `(..)` convention, which is similar to relative path convention `../` but for segments.\n\nYou can use:\n\n- `(.)` to match segments on the **same level**\n- `(..)` to match segments **one level above**\n- `(..)(..)` to match segments **two levels above**\n- `(...)` to match segments from the **root** `app` directory\n\nFor example, you can intercept the `photo` segment from within the `feed` segment by creating a `(..)photo` directory.\n\n<Image\n  alt=\"Intercepting routes folder structure\"\n  srcLight=\"/docs/light/intercepted-routes-files.png\"\n  srcDark=\"/docs/dark/intercepted-routes-files.png\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"604\"\n/>\n\n> Note that the `(..)` convention is based on _route segments_, not the file-system.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Modals\n\nIntercepting Routes can be used together with [Parallel Routes](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/parallel-routes) to create modals. This allows you to solve common challenges when building modals, such as:\n\n- Making the modal content **shareable through a URL**.\n- **Preserving context** when the page is refreshed, instead of closing the modal.\n- **Closing the modal on backwards navigation** rather than going to the previous route.\n- **Reopening the modal on forwards navigation**.\n\nConsider the following UI pattern, where a user can open a photo modal from a gallery using client-side navigation, or navigate to the photo page directly from a shareable URL:\n\n<Image\n  alt=\"Intercepting routes modal example\"\n  srcLight=\"/docs/light/intercepted-routes-modal-example.png\"\n  srcDark=\"/docs/dark/intercepted-routes-modal-example.png\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"976\"\n/>\n\nIn the above example, the path to the `photo` segment can use the `(..)` matcher since `@modal` is a slot and **not** a segment. This means that the `photo` route is only one segment level higher, despite being two file-system levels higher.\n\nSee the [Parallel Routes](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/parallel-routes#modals) documentation for a step-by-step example, or see our [image gallery example](https://github.com/vercel-labs/nextgram).\n\n> **Good to know:**\n>\n> - Other examples could include opening a login modal in a top navbar while also having a dedicated `/login` page, or opening a shopping cart in a side modal.\n"},{"path":"docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/01-routing/13-route-handlers.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/01-routing/13-route-handlers.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-handlers","sha":"237988906211f2e9f8083d39a182cd3408f95066","size":19149,"content":"---\ntitle: Route Handlers\ndescription: Create custom request handlers for a given route using the Web's Request and Response APIs.\nrelated:\n  title: API Reference\n  description: Learn more about the route.js file.\n  links:\n    - app/api-reference/file-conventions/route\n---\n\nRoute Handlers allow you to create custom request handlers for a given route using the Web [Request](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Request) and [Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Response) APIs.\n\n<Image\n  alt=\"Route.js Special File\"\n  srcLight=\"/docs/light/route-special-file.png\"\n  srcDark=\"/docs/dark/route-special-file.png\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"444\"\n/>\n\n> **Good to know**: Route Handlers are only available inside the `app` directory. They are the equivalent of [API Routes](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) inside the `pages` directory meaning you **do not** need to use API Routes and Route Handlers together.\n\n## Convention\n\nRoute Handlers are defined in a [`route.js|ts` file](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/route) inside the `app` directory:\n\n```ts filename=\"app/api/route.ts\" switcher\nexport async function GET(request: Request) {}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"app/api/route.js\" switcher\nexport async function GET(request) {}\n```\n\nRoute Handlers can be nested anywhere inside the `app` directory, similar to `page.js` and `layout.js`. But there **cannot** be a `route.js` file at the same route segment level as `page.js`.\n\n### Supported HTTP Methods\n\nThe following [HTTP methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods) are supported: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`, `HEAD`, and `OPTIONS`. If an unsupported method is called, Next.js will return a `405 Method Not Allowed` response.\n\n### Extended `NextRequest` and `NextResponse` APIs\n\nIn addition to supporting the native [Request](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Request) and [Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Response) APIs, Next.js extends them with [`NextRequest`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/next-request) and [`NextResponse`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/next-response) to provide convenient helpers for advanced use cases.\n\n## Behavior\n\n### Caching\n\nRoute Handlers are not cached by default. You can, however, opt into caching for `GET` methods. To do so, use a [route config option](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/route-segment-config#dynamic) such as `export const dynamic = 'force-static'` in your Route Handler file.\n\n```ts filename=\"app/items/route.ts\" switcher\nexport const dynamic = 'force-static'\n\nexport async function GET() {\n  const res = await fetch('https://data.mongodb-api.com/...', {\n    headers: {\n      'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n      'API-Key': process.env.DATA_API_KEY,\n    },\n  })\n  const data = await res.json()\n\n  return Response.json({ data })\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"app/items/route.js\" switcher\nexport const dynamic = 'force-static'\n\nexport async function GET() {\n  const res = await fetch('https://data.mongodb-api.com/...', {\n    headers: {\n      'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n      'API-Key': process.env.DATA_API_KEY,\n    },\n  })\n  const data = await res.json()\n\n  return Response.json({ data })\n}\n```\n\n### Special Route Handlers\n\nSpecial Route Handlers like [`sitemap.ts`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/metadata/sitemap), [`opengraph-image.tsx`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/metadata/opengraph-image), and [`icon.tsx`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/metadata/app-icons), and other [metadata files](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/metadata) remain static by default unless they use dynamic functions or dynamic config options.\n\n### Route Resolution\n\nYou can consider a `route` the lowest level routing primitive.\n\n- They **do not** participate in layouts or client-side navigations like `page`.\n- There **cannot** be a `route.js` file at the same route as `page.js`.\n\n| Page                 | Route              | Result                       |\n| -------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------- |\n| `app/page.js`        | `app/route.js`     | <Cross size={18} /> Conflict |\n| `app/page.js`        | `app/api/route.js` | <Check size={18} /> Valid    |\n| `app/[user]/page.js` | `app/api/route.js` | <Check size={18} /> Valid    |\n\nEach `route.js` or `page.js` file takes over all HTTP verbs for that route.\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/page.js\"\nexport default function Page() {\n  return <h1>Hello, Next.js!</h1>\n}\n\n// ❌ Conflict\n// `app/route.js`\nexport async function POST(request) {}\n```\n\n## Examples\n\nThe following examples show how to combine Route Handlers with other Next.js APIs and features.\n\n### Revalidating Cached Data\n\nYou can [revalidate cached data](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/caching-and-revalidating#revalidating-data) using the [`next.revalidate`](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/caching-and-revalidating#revalidating-data) option:\n\n```ts filename=\"app/items/route.ts\" switcher\nexport async function GET() {\n  const res = await fetch('https://data.mongodb-api.com/...', {\n    next: { revalidate: 60 }, // Revalidate every 60 seconds\n  })\n  const data = await res.json()\n\n  return Response.json(data)\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"app/items/route.js\" switcher\nexport async function GET() {\n  const res = await fetch('https://data.mongodb-api.com/...', {\n    next: { revalidate: 60 }, // Revalidate every 60 seconds\n  })\n  const data = await res.json()\n\n  return Response.json(data)\n}\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use the [`revalidate` segment config option](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/route-segment-config#revalidate):\n\n```ts\nexport const revalidate = 60\n```\n\n### Dynamic Functions\n\nRoute Handlers can be used with dynamic functions from Next.js, like [`cookies`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/cookies) and [`headers`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/headers).\n\n#### Cookies\n\nYou can read or set cookies with [`cookies`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/cookies) from `next/headers`. This server function can be called directly in a Route Handler, or nested inside of another function.\n\nAlternatively, you can return a new `Response` using the [`Set-Cookie`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie) header.\n\n```ts filename=\"app/api/route.ts\" switcher\nimport { cookies } from 'next/headers'\n\nexport async function GET(request: Request) {\n  const cookieStore = cookies()\n  const token = cookieStore.get('token')\n\n  return new Response('Hello, Next.js!', {\n    status: 200,\n    headers: { 'Set-Cookie': `token=${token.value}` },\n  })\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"app/api/route.js\" switcher\nimport { cookies } from 'next/headers'\n\nexport async function GET(request) {\n  const cookieStore = cookies()\n  const token = cookieStore.get('token')\n\n  return new Response('Hello, Next.js!', {\n    status: 200,\n    headers: { 'Set-Cookie': `token=${token}` },\n  })\n}\n```\n\nYou can also use the underlying Web APIs to read cookies from the request ([`NextRequest`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/next-request)):\n\n```ts filename=\"app/api/route.ts\" switcher\nimport { type NextRequest } from 'next/server'\n\nexport async function GET(request: NextRequest) {\n  const token = request.cookies.get('token')\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"app/api/route.js\" switcher\nexport async function GET(request) {\n  const token = request.cookies.get('token')\n}\n```\n\n#### Headers\n\nYou can read headers with [`headers`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/headers) from `next/headers`. This server function can be called directly in a Route Handler, or nested inside of another function.\n\nThis `headers` instance is read-only. To set headers, you need to return a new `Response` with new `headers`.\n\n```ts filename=\"app/api/route.ts\" switcher\nimport { headers } from 'next/headers'\n\nexport async function GET(request: Request) {\n  const headersList = headers()\n  const referer = headersList.get('referer')\n\n  return new Response('Hello, Next.js!', {\n    status: 200,\n    headers: { referer: referer },\n  })\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"app/api/route.js\" switcher\nimport { headers } from 'next/headers'\n\nexport async function GET(request) {\n  const headersList = headers()\n  const referer = headersList.get('referer')\n\n  return new Response('Hello, Next.js!', {\n    status: 200,\n    headers: { referer: referer },\n  })\n}\n```\n\nYou can also use the underlying Web APIs to read headers from the request ([`NextRequest`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/next-request)):\n\n```ts filename=\"app/api/route.ts\" switcher\nimport { type NextRequest } from 'next/server'\n\nexport async function GET(request: NextRequest) {\n  const requestHeaders = new Headers(request.headers)\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"app/api/route.js\" switcher\nexport async function GET(request) {\n  const requestHeaders = new Headers(request.headers)\n}\n```\n\n### Redirects\n\n```ts filename=\"app/api/route.ts\" switcher\nimport { redirect } from 'next/navigation'\n\nexport async function GET(request: Request) {\n  redirect('https://nextjs.org/')\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"app/api/route.js\" switcher\nimport { redirect } from 'next/navigation'\n\nexport async function GET(request) {\n  redirect('https://nextjs.org/')\n}\n```\n\n### Dynamic Route Segments\n\n> We recommend reading the [Defining Routes](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/defining-routes) page before continuing.\n\nRoute Handlers can use [Dynamic Segments](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes) to create request handlers from dynamic data.\n\n```ts filename=\"app/items/[slug]/route.ts\" switcher\nexport async function GET(\n  request: Request,\n  { params }: { params: { slug: string } }\n) {\n  const slug = params.slug // 'a', 'b', or 'c'\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"app/items/[slug]/route.js\" switcher\nexport async function GET(request, { params }) {\n  const slug = params.slug // 'a', 'b', or 'c'\n}\n```\n\n| Route                       | Example URL | `params`        |\n| --------------------------- | ----------- | --------------- |\n| `app/items/[slug]/route.js` | `/items/a`  | `{ slug: 'a' }` |\n| `app/items/[slug]/route.js` | `/items/b`  | `{ slug: 'b' }` |\n| `app/items/[slug]/route.js` | `/items/c`  | `{ slug: 'c' }` |\n\n### URL Query Parameters\n\nThe request object passed to the Route Handler is a `NextRequest` instance, which has [some additional convenience methods](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/next-request#nexturl), including for more easily handling query parameters.\n\n```ts filename=\"app/api/search/route.ts\" switcher\nimport { type NextRequest } from 'next/server'\n\nexport function GET(request: NextRequest) {\n  const searchParams = request.nextUrl.searchParams\n  const query = searchParams.get('query')\n  // query is \"hello\" for /api/search?query=hello\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"app/api/search/route.js\" switcher\nexport function GET(request) {\n  const searchParams = request.nextUrl.searchParams\n  const query = searchParams.get('query')\n  // query is \"hello\" for /api/search?query=hello\n}\n```\n\n### Streaming\n\nStreaming is commonly used in combination with Large Language Models (LLMs), such as OpenAI, for AI-generated content. Learn more about the [AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/introduction).\n\n```ts filename=\"app/api/chat/route.ts\" switcher\nimport { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai'\nimport { StreamingTextResponse, streamText } from 'ai'\n\nexport async function POST(req) {\n  const { messages } = await req.json()\n  const result = await streamText({\n    model: openai('gpt-4-turbo'),\n    messages,\n  })\n\n  return new StreamingTextResponse(result.toAIStream())\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"app/api/chat/route.js\" switcher\nimport { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai'\nimport { StreamingTextResponse, streamText } from 'ai'\n\nexport async function POST(req: Request) {\n  const { messages } = await req.json()\n  const result = await streamText({\n    model: openai('gpt-4-turbo'),\n    messages,\n  })\n\n  return new StreamingTextResponse(result.toAIStream())\n}\n```\n\nThese abstractions use the Web APIs to create a stream. You can also use the underlying Web APIs directly.\n\n```ts filename=\"app/api/route.ts\" switcher\n// https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/ReadableStream#convert_async_iterator_to_stream\nfunction iteratorToStream(iterator: any) {\n  return new ReadableStream({\n    async pull(controller) {\n      const { value, done } = await iterator.next()\n\n      if (done) {\n        controller.close()\n      } else {\n        controller.enqueue(value)\n      }\n    },\n  })\n}\n\nfunction sleep(time: number) {\n  return new Promise((resolve) => {\n    setTimeout(resolve, time)\n  })\n}\n\nconst encoder = new TextEncoder()\n\nasync function* makeIterator() {\n  yield encoder.encode('<p>One</p>')\n  await sleep(200)\n  yield encoder.encode('<p>Two</p>')\n  await sleep(200)\n  yield encoder.encode('<p>Three</p>')\n}\n\nexport async function GET() {\n  const iterator = makeIterator()\n  const stream = iteratorToStream(iterator)\n\n  return new Response(stream)\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"app/api/route.js\" switcher\n// https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/ReadableStream#convert_async_iterator_to_stream\nfunction iteratorToStream(iterator) {\n  return new ReadableStream({\n    async pull(controller) {\n      const { value, done } = await iterator.next()\n\n      if (done) {\n        controller.close()\n      } else {\n        controller.enqueue(value)\n      }\n    },\n  })\n}\n\nfunction sleep(time) {\n  return new Promise((resolve) => {\n    setTimeout(resolve, time)\n  })\n}\n\nconst encoder = new TextEncoder()\n\nasync function* makeIterator() {\n  yield encoder.encode('<p>One</p>')\n  await sleep(200)\n  yield encoder.encode('<p>Two</p>')\n  await sleep(200)\n  yield encoder.encode('<p>Three</p>')\n}\n\nexport async function GET() {\n  const iterator = makeIterator()\n  const stream = iteratorToStream(iterator)\n\n  return new Response(stream)\n}\n```\n\n### Request Body\n\nYou can read the `Request` body using the standard Web API methods:\n\n```ts filename=\"app/items/route.ts\" switcher\nexport async function POST(request: Request) {\n  const res = await request.json()\n  return Response.json({ res })\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"app/items/route.js\" switcher\nexport async function POST(request) {\n  const res = await request.json()\n  return Response.json({ res })\n}\n```\n\n### Request Body FormData\n\nYou can read the `FormData` using the `request.formData()` function:\n\n```ts filename=\"app/items/route.ts\" switcher\nexport async function POST(request: Request) {\n  const formData = await request.formData()\n  const name = formData.get('name')\n  const email = formData.get('email')\n  return Response.json({ name, email })\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"app/items/route.js\" switcher\nexport async function POST(request) {\n  const formData = await request.formData()\n  const name = formData.get('name')\n  const email = formData.get('email')\n  return Response.json({ name, email })\n}\n```\n\nSince `formData` data are all strings, you may want to use [`zod-form-data`](https://www.npmjs.com/zod-form-data) to validate the request and retrieve data in the format you prefer (e.g. `number`).\n\n### CORS\n\nYou can set CORS headers for a specific Route Handler using the standard Web API methods:\n\n```ts filename=\"app/api/route.ts\" switcher\nexport async function GET(request: Request) {\n  return new Response('Hello, Next.js!', {\n    status: 200,\n    headers: {\n      'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*',\n      'Access-Control-Allow-Methods': 'GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS',\n      'Access-Control-Allow-Headers': 'Content-Type, Authorization',\n    },\n  })\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"app/api/route.js\" switcher\nexport async function GET(request) {\n  return new Response('Hello, Next.js!', {\n    status: 200,\n    headers: {\n      'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*',\n      'Access-Control-Allow-Methods': 'GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS',\n      'Access-Control-Allow-Headers': 'Content-Type, Authorization',\n    },\n  })\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know**:\n>\n> - To add CORS headers to multiple Route Handlers, you can use [Middleware](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware#cors) or the [`next.config.js` file](/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/headers#cors).\n> - Alternatively, see our [CORS example](https://github.com/vercel/examples/blob/main/edge-functions/cors/lib/cors.ts) package.\n\n### Webhooks\n\nYou can use a Route Handler to receive webhooks from third-party services:\n\n```ts filename=\"app/api/route.ts\" switcher\nexport async function POST(request: Request) {\n  try {\n    const text = await request.text()\n    // Process the webhook payload\n  } catch (error) {\n    return new Response(`Webhook error: ${error.message}`, {\n      status: 400,\n    })\n  }\n\n  return new Response('Success!', {\n    status: 200,\n  })\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"app/api/route.js\" switcher\nexport async function POST(request) {\n  try {\n    const text = await request.text()\n    // Process the webhook payload\n  } catch (error) {\n    return new Response(`Webhook error: ${error.message}`, {\n      status: 400,\n    })\n  }\n\n  return new Response('Success!', {\n    status: 200,\n  })\n}\n```\n\nNotably, unlike API Routes with the Pages Router, you do not need to use `bodyParser` to use any additional configuration.\n\n### Non-UI Responses\n\nYou can use Route Handlers to return non-UI content. Note that [`sitemap.xml`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/metadata/sitemap#generating-a-sitemap-using-code-js-ts), [`robots.txt`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/metadata/robots#generate-a-robots-file), [`app icons`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/metadata/app-icons#generate-icons-using-code-js-ts-tsx), and [open graph images](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/metadata/opengraph-image) all have built-in support.\n\n```ts filename=\"app/rss.xml/route.ts\" switcher\nexport async function GET() {\n  return new Response(\n    `<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" ?>\n<rss version=\"2.0\">\n\n<channel>\n  <title>Next.js Documentation</title>\n  <link>https://nextjs.org/docs</link>\n  <description>The React Framework for the Web</description>\n</channel>\n\n</rss>`,\n    {\n      headers: {\n        'Content-Type': 'text/xml',\n      },\n    }\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"app/rss.xml/route.js\" switcher\nexport async function GET() {\n  return new Response(`<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" ?>\n<rss version=\"2.0\">\n\n<channel>\n  <title>Next.js Documentation</title>\n  <link>https://nextjs.org/docs</link>\n  <description>The React Framework for the Web</description>\n</channel>\n\n</rss>`)\n}\n```\n\n### Segment Config Options\n\nRoute Handlers use the same [route segment configuration](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/route-segment-config) as pages and layouts.\n\n```ts filename=\"app/items/route.ts\" switcher\nexport const dynamic = 'auto'\nexport const dynamicParams = true\nexport const revalidate = false\nexport const fetchCache = 'auto'\nexport const runtime = 'nodejs'\nexport const preferredRegion = 'auto'\n```\n\n```js filename=\"app/items/route.js\" switcher\nexport const dynamic = 'auto'\nexport const dynamicParams = true\nexport const revalidate = false\nexport const fetchCache = 'auto'\nexport const runtime = 'nodejs'\nexport const preferredRegion = 'auto'\n```\n\nSee the [API reference](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/route-segment-config) for more details.\n"},{"path":"docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/01-routing/index.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/01-routing/index.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing","sha":"9fd5f906d65aac6f4fa7681124d776faffcd0d10","size":8948,"content":"---\ntitle: Routing Fundamentals\nnav_title: Routing\ndescription: Learn the fundamentals of routing for front-end applications.\n---\n\nThe skeleton of every application is routing. This page will introduce you to the **fundamental concepts** of routing for the web and how to handle routing in Next.js.\n\n## Terminology\n\nFirst, you will see these terms being used throughout the documentation. Here's a quick reference:\n\n<Image\n  alt=\"Terminology for Component Tree\"\n  srcLight=\"/docs/light/terminology-component-tree.png\"\n  srcDark=\"/docs/dark/terminology-component-tree.png\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"832\"\n/>\n\n- **Tree:** A convention for visualizing a hierarchical structure. For example, a component tree with parent and children components, a folder structure, etc.\n- **Subtree:** Part of a tree, starting at a new root (first) and ending at the leaves (last).\n- **Root**: The first node in a tree or subtree, such as a root layout.\n- **Leaf:** Nodes in a subtree that have no children, such as the last segment in a URL path.\n\n<Image\n  alt=\"Terminology for URL Anatomy\"\n  srcLight=\"/docs/light/terminology-url-anatomy.png\"\n  srcDark=\"/docs/dark/terminology-url-anatomy.png\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"371\"\n/>\n\n- **URL Segment:** Part of the URL path delimited by slashes.\n- **URL Path:** Part of the URL that comes after the domain (composed of segments).\n\n## The `app` Router\n\nIn version 13, Next.js introduced a new **App Router** built on [React Server Components](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components), which supports shared layouts, nested routing, loading states, error handling, and more.\n\nThe App Router works in a new directory named `app`. The `app` directory works alongside the `pages` directory to allow for incremental adoption. This allows you to opt some routes of your application into the new behavior while keeping other routes in the `pages` directory for previous behavior. If your application uses the `pages` directory, please also see the [Pages Router](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing) documentation.\n\n> **Good to know**: The App Router takes priority over the Pages Router. Routes across directories should not resolve to the same URL path and will cause a build-time error to prevent a conflict.\n\n<Image\n  alt=\"Next.js App Directory\"\n  srcLight=\"/docs/light/next-router-directories.png\"\n  srcDark=\"/docs/dark/next-router-directories.png\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"444\"\n/>\n\nBy default, components inside `app` are [React Server Components](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components). This is a performance optimization and allows you to easily adopt them, and you can also use [Client Components](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/client-components).\n\n> **Recommendation:** Check out the [Server](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components) page if you're new to Server Components.\n\n## Roles of Folders and Files\n\nNext.js uses a file-system based router where:\n\n- **Folders** are used to define routes. A route is a single path of nested folders, following the file-system hierarchy from the **root folder** down to a final **leaf folder** that includes a `page.js` file. See [Defining Routes](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/defining-routes).\n- **Files** are used to create UI that is shown for a route segment. See [special files](#file-conventions).\n\n## Route Segments\n\nEach folder in a route represents a **route segment**. Each route segment is mapped to a corresponding **segment** in a **URL path**.\n\n<Image\n  alt=\"How Route Segments Map to URL Segments\"\n  srcLight=\"/docs/light/route-segments-to-path-segments.png\"\n  srcDark=\"/docs/dark/route-segments-to-path-segments.png\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"594\"\n/>\n\n## Nested Routes\n\nTo create a nested route, you can nest folders inside each other. For example, you can add a new `/dashboard/settings` route by nesting two new folders in the `app` directory.\n\nThe `/dashboard/settings` route is composed of three segments:\n\n- `/` (Root segment)\n- `dashboard` (Segment)\n- `settings` (Leaf segment)\n\n## File Conventions\n\nNext.js provides a set of special files to create UI with specific behavior in nested routes:\n\n|                                                                                           |                                                                                                |\n| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| [`layout`](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/layouts-and-templates#layouts)     | Shared UI for a segment and its children                                                       |\n| [`page`](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/pages)                               | Unique UI of a route and make routes publicly accessible                                       |\n| [`loading`](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/loading-ui-and-streaming)         | Loading UI for a segment and its children                                                      |\n| [`not-found`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/not-found)                         | Not found UI for a segment and its children                                                    |\n| [`error`](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/error-handling)                     | Error UI for a segment and its children                                                        |\n| [`global-error`](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/error-handling)              | Global Error UI                                                                                |\n| [`route`](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-handlers)                     | Server-side API endpoint                                                                       |\n| [`template`](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/layouts-and-templates#templates) | Specialized re-rendered Layout UI                                                              |\n| [`default`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/default)                             | Fallback UI for [Parallel Routes](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/parallel-routes) |\n\n> **Good to know**: `.js`, `.jsx`, or `.tsx` file extensions can be used for special files.\n\n## Component Hierarchy\n\nThe React components defined in special files of a route segment are rendered in a specific hierarchy:\n\n- `layout.js`\n- `template.js`\n- `error.js` (React error boundary)\n- `loading.js` (React suspense boundary)\n- `not-found.js` (React error boundary)\n- `page.js` or nested `layout.js`\n\n<Image\n  alt=\"Component Hierarchy for File Conventions\"\n  srcLight=\"/docs/light/file-conventions-component-hierarchy.png\"\n  srcDark=\"/docs/dark/file-conventions-component-hierarchy.png\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"643\"\n/>\n\nIn a nested route, the components of a segment will be nested **inside** the components of its parent segment.\n\n<Image\n  alt=\"Nested File Conventions Component Hierarchy\"\n  srcLight=\"/docs/light/nested-file-conventions-component-hierarchy.png\"\n  srcDark=\"/docs/dark/nested-file-conventions-component-hierarchy.png\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"863\"\n/>\n\n## Colocation\n\nIn addition to special files, you have the option to colocate your own files (e.g. components, styles, tests, etc) inside folders in the `app` directory.\n\nThis is because while folders define routes, only the contents returned by `page.js` or `route.js` are publicly addressable.\n\n<Image\n  alt=\"An example folder structure with colocated files\"\n  srcLight=\"/docs/light/project-organization-colocation.png\"\n  srcDark=\"/docs/dark/project-organization-colocation.png\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"1011\"\n/>\n\nLearn more about [Project Organization and Colocation](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/colocation).\n\n## Advanced Routing Patterns\n\nThe App Router also provides a set of conventions to help you implement more advanced routing patterns. These include:\n\n- [Parallel Routes](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/parallel-routes): Allow you to simultaneously show two or more pages in the same view that can be navigated independently. You can use them for split views that have their own sub-navigation. E.g. Dashboards.\n- [Intercepting Routes](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/intercepting-routes): Allow you to intercept a route and show it in the context of another route. You can use these when keeping the context for the current page is important. E.g. Seeing all tasks while editing one task or expanding a photo in a feed.\n\nThese patterns allow you to build richer and more complex UIs, democratizing features that were historically complex for small teams and individual developers to implement.\n\n## Next Steps\n\nNow that you understand the fundamentals of routing in Next.js, follow the links below to create your first routes:\n"},{"path":"docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/01-routing/14-middleware.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/01-routing/14-middleware.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware","sha":"e2388fec2d5db9e816bfd2609fbc0f1c02947bdd","size":21725,"content":"---\ntitle: Middleware\ndescription: Learn how to use Middleware to run code before a request is completed.\n---\n\n{/* The content of this doc is shared between the app and pages router. You can use the `<PagesOnly>Content</PagesOnly>` component to add content that is specific to the Pages Router. Any shared content should not be wrapped in a component. */}\n\nMiddleware allows you to run code before a request is completed. Then, based on the incoming request, you can modify the response by rewriting, redirecting, modifying the request or response headers, or responding directly.\n\nMiddleware runs before cached content and routes are matched. See [Matching Paths](#matching-paths) for more details.\n\n## Use Cases\n\nIntegrating Middleware into your application can lead to significant improvements in performance, security, and user experience. Some common scenarios where Middleware is particularly effective include:\n\n- Authentication and Authorization: Ensure user identity and check session cookies before granting access to specific pages or API routes.\n- Server-Side Redirects: Redirect users at the server level based on certain conditions (e.g., locale, user role).\n- Path Rewriting: Support A/B testing, feature rollouts, or legacy paths by dynamically rewriting paths to API routes or pages based on request properties.\n- Bot Detection: Protect your resources by detecting and blocking bot traffic.\n- Logging and Analytics: Capture and analyze request data for insights before processing by the page or API.\n- Feature Flagging: Enable or disable features dynamically for seamless feature rollouts or testing.\n\nRecognizing situations where middleware may not be the optimal approach is just as crucial. Here are some scenarios to be mindful of:\n\n- Complex Data Fetching and Manipulation: Middleware is not designed for direct data fetching or manipulation, this should be done within Route Handlers or server-side utilities instead.\n- Heavy Computational Tasks: Middleware should be lightweight and respond quickly or it can cause delays in page load. Heavy computational tasks or long-running processes should be done within dedicated Route Handlers.\n- Extensive Session Management: While Middleware can manage basic session tasks, extensive session management should be managed by dedicated authentication services or within Route Handlers.\n- Direct Database Operations: Performing direct database operations within Middleware is not recommended. Database interactions should done within Route Handlers or server-side utilities.\n\n## Convention\n\nUse the file `middleware.ts` (or `.js`) in the root of your project to define Middleware. For example, at the same level as `pages` or `app`, or inside `src` if applicable.\n\n> **Note**: While only one `middleware.ts` file is supported per project, you can still organize your middleware logic modularly. Break out middleware functionalities into separate `.ts` or `.js` files and import them into your main `middleware.ts` file. This allows for cleaner management of route-specific middleware, aggregated in the `middleware.ts` for centralized control. By enforcing a single middleware file, it simplifies configuration, prevents potential conflicts, and optimizes performance by avoiding multiple middleware layers.\n\n## Example\n\n```ts filename=\"middleware.ts\" switcher\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\nimport type { NextRequest } from 'next/server'\n\n// This function can be marked `async` if using `await` inside\nexport function middleware(request: NextRequest) {\n  return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/home', request.url))\n}\n\n// See \"Matching Paths\" below to learn more\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: '/about/:path*',\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"middleware.js\" switcher\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n\n// This function can be marked `async` if using `await` inside\nexport function middleware(request) {\n  return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/home', request.url))\n}\n\n// See \"Matching Paths\" below to learn more\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: '/about/:path*',\n}\n```\n\n## Matching Paths\n\nMiddleware will be invoked for **every route in your project**. Given this, it's crucial to use matchers to precisely target or exclude specific routes. The following is the execution order:\n\n1. `headers` from `next.config.js`\n2. `redirects` from `next.config.js`\n3. Middleware (`rewrites`, `redirects`, etc.)\n4. `beforeFiles` (`rewrites`) from `next.config.js`\n5. Filesystem routes (`public/`, `_next/static/`, `pages/`, `app/`, etc.)\n6. `afterFiles` (`rewrites`) from `next.config.js`\n7. Dynamic Routes (`/blog/[slug]`)\n8. `fallback` (`rewrites`) from `next.config.js`\n\nThere are two ways to define which paths Middleware will run on:\n\n1. [Custom matcher config](#matcher)\n2. [Conditional statements](#conditional-statements)\n\n### Matcher\n\n`matcher` allows you to filter Middleware to run on specific paths.\n\n```js filename=\"middleware.js\"\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: '/about/:path*',\n}\n```\n\nYou can match a single path or multiple paths with an array syntax:\n\n```js filename=\"middleware.js\"\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: ['/about/:path*', '/dashboard/:path*'],\n}\n```\n\nThe `matcher` config allows full regex so matching like negative lookaheads or character matching is supported. An example of a negative lookahead to match all except specific paths can be seen here:\n\n```js filename=\"middleware.js\"\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: [\n    /*\n     * Match all request paths except for the ones starting with:\n     * - api (API routes)\n     * - _next/static (static files)\n     * - _next/image (image optimization files)\n     * - favicon.ico (favicon file)\n     */\n    '/((?!api|_next/static|_next/image|favicon.ico).*)',\n  ],\n}\n```\n\nYou can also bypass Middleware for certain requests by using the `missing` or `has` arrays, or a combination of both:\n\n```js filename=\"middleware.js\"\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: [\n    /*\n     * Match all request paths except for the ones starting with:\n     * - api (API routes)\n     * - _next/static (static files)\n     * - _next/image (image optimization files)\n     * - favicon.ico (favicon file)\n     */\n    {\n      source: '/((?!api|_next/static|_next/image|favicon.ico).*)',\n      missing: [\n        { type: 'header', key: 'next-router-prefetch' },\n        { type: 'header', key: 'purpose', value: 'prefetch' },\n      ],\n    },\n\n    {\n      source: '/((?!api|_next/static|_next/image|favicon.ico).*)',\n      has: [\n        { type: 'header', key: 'next-router-prefetch' },\n        { type: 'header', key: 'purpose', value: 'prefetch' },\n      ],\n    },\n\n    {\n      source: '/((?!api|_next/static|_next/image|favicon.ico).*)',\n      has: [{ type: 'header', key: 'x-present' }],\n      missing: [{ type: 'header', key: 'x-missing', value: 'prefetch' }],\n    },\n  ],\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know**: The `matcher` values need to be constants so they can be statically analyzed at build-time. Dynamic values such as variables will be ignored.\n\nConfigured matchers:\n\n1. MUST start with `/`\n2. Can include named parameters: `/about/:path` matches `/about/a` and `/about/b` but not `/about/a/c`\n3. Can have modifiers on named parameters (starting with `:`): `/about/:path*` matches `/about/a/b/c` because `*` is _zero or more_. `?` is _zero or one_ and `+` _one or more_\n4. Can use regular expression enclosed in parenthesis: `/about/(.*)` is the same as `/about/:path*`\n\nRead more details on [path-to-regexp](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp#path-to-regexp-1) documentation.\n\n> **Good to know**: For backward compatibility, Next.js always considers `/public` as `/public/index`. Therefore, a matcher of `/public/:path` will match.\n\n### Conditional Statements\n\n```ts filename=\"middleware.ts\" switcher\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\nimport type { NextRequest } from 'next/server'\n\nexport function middleware(request: NextRequest) {\n  if (request.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/about')) {\n    return NextResponse.rewrite(new URL('/about-2', request.url))\n  }\n\n  if (request.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/dashboard')) {\n    return NextResponse.rewrite(new URL('/dashboard/user', request.url))\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"middleware.js\" switcher\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n\nexport function middleware(request) {\n  if (request.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/about')) {\n    return NextResponse.rewrite(new URL('/about-2', request.url))\n  }\n\n  if (request.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/dashboard')) {\n    return NextResponse.rewrite(new URL('/dashboard/user', request.url))\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## NextResponse\n\nThe `NextResponse` API allows you to:\n\n- `redirect` the incoming request to a different URL\n- `rewrite` the response by displaying a given URL\n- Set request headers for API Routes, `getServerSideProps`, and `rewrite` destinations\n- Set response cookies\n- Set response headers\n\n<AppOnly>\n\nTo produce a response from Middleware, you can:\n\n1. `rewrite` to a route ([Page](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/layouts-and-templates) or [Route Handler](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-handlers)) that produces a response\n2. return a `NextResponse` directly. See [Producing a Response](#producing-a-response)\n\n</AppOnly>\n\n<PagesOnly>\n\nTo produce a response from Middleware, you can:\n\n1. `rewrite` to a route ([Page](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts) or [Edge API Route](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes)) that produces a response\n2. return a `NextResponse` directly. See [Producing a Response](#producing-a-response)\n\n</PagesOnly>\n\n## Using Cookies\n\nCookies are regular headers. On a `Request`, they are stored in the `Cookie` header. On a `Response` they are in the `Set-Cookie` header. Next.js provides a convenient way to access and manipulate these cookies through the `cookies` extension on `NextRequest` and `NextResponse`.\n\n1. For incoming requests, `cookies` comes with the following methods: `get`, `getAll`, `set`, and `delete` cookies. You can check for the existence of a cookie with `has` or remove all cookies with `clear`.\n2. For outgoing responses, `cookies` have the following methods `get`, `getAll`, `set`, and `delete`.\n\n```ts filename=\"middleware.ts\" switcher\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\nimport type { NextRequest } from 'next/server'\n\nexport function middleware(request: NextRequest) {\n  // Assume a \"Cookie:nextjs=fast\" header to be present on the incoming request\n  // Getting cookies from the request using the `RequestCookies` API\n  let cookie = request.cookies.get('nextjs')\n  console.log(cookie) // => { name: 'nextjs', value: 'fast', Path: '/' }\n  const allCookies = request.cookies.getAll()\n  console.log(allCookies) // => [{ name: 'nextjs', value: 'fast' }]\n\n  request.cookies.has('nextjs') // => true\n  request.cookies.delete('nextjs')\n  request.cookies.has('nextjs') // => false\n\n  // Setting cookies on the response using the `ResponseCookies` API\n  const response = NextResponse.next()\n  response.cookies.set('vercel', 'fast')\n  response.cookies.set({\n    name: 'vercel',\n    value: 'fast',\n    path: '/',\n  })\n  cookie = response.cookies.get('vercel')\n  console.log(cookie) // => { name: 'vercel', value: 'fast', Path: '/' }\n  // The outgoing response will have a `Set-Cookie:vercel=fast;path=/` header.\n\n  return response\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"middleware.js\" switcher\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n\nexport function middleware(request) {\n  // Assume a \"Cookie:nextjs=fast\" header to be present on the incoming request\n  // Getting cookies from the request using the `RequestCookies` API\n  let cookie = request.cookies.get('nextjs')\n  console.log(cookie) // => { name: 'nextjs', value: 'fast', Path: '/' }\n  const allCookies = request.cookies.getAll()\n  console.log(allCookies) // => [{ name: 'nextjs', value: 'fast' }]\n\n  request.cookies.has('nextjs') // => true\n  request.cookies.delete('nextjs')\n  request.cookies.has('nextjs') // => false\n\n  // Setting cookies on the response using the `ResponseCookies` API\n  const response = NextResponse.next()\n  response.cookies.set('vercel', 'fast')\n  response.cookies.set({\n    name: 'vercel',\n    value: 'fast',\n    path: '/',\n  })\n  cookie = response.cookies.get('vercel')\n  console.log(cookie) // => { name: 'vercel', value: 'fast', Path: '/' }\n  // The outgoing response will have a `Set-Cookie:vercel=fast;path=/test` header.\n\n  return response\n}\n```\n\n## Setting Headers\n\nYou can set request and response headers using the `NextResponse` API (setting _request_ headers is available since Next.js v13.0.0).\n\n```ts filename=\"middleware.ts\" switcher\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\nimport type { NextRequest } from 'next/server'\n\nexport function middleware(request: NextRequest) {\n  // Clone the request headers and set a new header `x-hello-from-middleware1`\n  const requestHeaders = new Headers(request.headers)\n  requestHeaders.set('x-hello-from-middleware1', 'hello')\n\n  // You can also set request headers in NextResponse.rewrite\n  const response = NextResponse.next({\n    request: {\n      // New request headers\n      headers: requestHeaders,\n    },\n  })\n\n  // Set a new response header `x-hello-from-middleware2`\n  response.headers.set('x-hello-from-middleware2', 'hello')\n  return response\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"middleware.js\" switcher\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n\nexport function middleware(request) {\n  // Clone the request headers and set a new header `x-hello-from-middleware1`\n  const requestHeaders = new Headers(request.headers)\n  requestHeaders.set('x-hello-from-middleware1', 'hello')\n\n  // You can also set request headers in NextResponse.rewrite\n  const response = NextResponse.next({\n    request: {\n      // New request headers\n      headers: requestHeaders,\n    },\n  })\n\n  // Set a new response header `x-hello-from-middleware2`\n  response.headers.set('x-hello-from-middleware2', 'hello')\n  return response\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know**: Avoid setting large headers as it might cause [431 Request Header Fields Too Large](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/431) error depending on your backend web server configuration.\n\n### CORS\n\nYou can set CORS headers in Middleware to allow cross-origin requests, including [simple](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS#simple_requests) and [preflighted](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS#preflighted_requests) requests.\n\n```tsx filename=\"middleware.ts\" switcher\nimport { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n\nconst allowedOrigins = ['https://acme.com', 'https://my-app.org']\n\nconst corsOptions = {\n  'Access-Control-Allow-Methods': 'GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS',\n  'Access-Control-Allow-Headers': 'Content-Type, Authorization',\n}\n\nexport function middleware(request: NextRequest) {\n  // Check the origin from the request\n  const origin = request.headers.get('origin') ?? ''\n  const isAllowedOrigin = allowedOrigins.includes(origin)\n\n  // Handle preflighted requests\n  const isPreflight = request.method === 'OPTIONS'\n\n  if (isPreflight) {\n    const preflightHeaders = {\n      ...(isAllowedOrigin && { 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': origin }),\n      ...corsOptions,\n    }\n    return NextResponse.json({}, { headers: preflightHeaders })\n  }\n\n  // Handle simple requests\n  const response = NextResponse.next()\n\n  if (isAllowedOrigin) {\n    response.headers.set('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', origin)\n  }\n\n  Object.entries(corsOptions).forEach(([key, value]) => {\n    response.headers.set(key, value)\n  })\n\n  return response\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: '/api/:path*',\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"middleware.js\" switcher\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n\nconst allowedOrigins = ['https://acme.com', 'https://my-app.org']\n\nconst corsOptions = {\n  'Access-Control-Allow-Methods': 'GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS',\n  'Access-Control-Allow-Headers': 'Content-Type, Authorization',\n}\n\nexport function middleware(request) {\n  // Check the origin from the request\n  const origin = request.headers.get('origin') ??

(This is available since [Next.js v13.1.0](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-13-1#nextjs-advanced-middleware))\n\n```ts filename=\"middleware.ts\" switcher\nimport type { NextRequest } from 'next/server'\nimport { isAuthenticated } from '@lib/auth'\n\n// Limit the middleware to paths starting with `/api/`\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: '/api/:function*',\n}\n\nexport function middleware(request: NextRequest) {\n  // Call our authentication function to check the request\n  if (!isAuthenticated(request)) {\n    // Respond with JSON indicating an error message\n    return Response.json(\n      { success: false, message: 'authentication failed' },\n      { status: 401 }\n    )\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"middleware.js\" switcher\nimport { isAuthenticated } from '@lib/auth'\n\n// Limit the middleware to paths starting with `/api/`\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: '/api/:function*',\n}\n\nexport function middleware(request) {\n  // Call our authentication function to check the request\n  if (!isAuthenticated(request)) {\n    // Respond with JSON indicating an error message\n    return Response.json(\n      { success: false, message: 'authentication failed' },\n      { status: 401 }\n    )\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### `waitUntil` and `NextFetchEvent`\n\nThe `NextFetchEvent` object extends the native [`FetchEvent`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/FetchEvent) object, and includes the [`waitUntil()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/ExtendableEvent/waitUntil) method.\n\nThe `waitUntil()` method takes a promise as an argument, and extends the lifetime of the Middleware until the promise settles. This is useful for performing work in the background.\n\n```ts filename=\"middleware.ts\"\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\nimport type { NextFetchEvent, NextRequest } from 'next/server'\n\nexport function middleware(req: NextRequest, event: NextFetchEvent) {\n  event.waitUntil(\n    fetch('https://my-analytics-platform.com', {\n      method: 'POST',\n      body: JSON.stringify({ pathname: req.nextUrl.pathname }),\n    })\n  )\n\n  return NextResponse.next()\n}\n```\n\n## Advanced Middleware Flags\n\nIn `v13.1` of Next.js two additional flags were introduced for middleware, `skipMiddlewareUrlNormalize` and `skipTrailingSlashRedirect` to handle advanced use cases.\n\n`skipTrailingSlashRedirect` disables Next.js redirects for adding or removing trailing slashes. This allows custom handling inside middleware to maintain the trailing slash for some paths but not others, which can make incremental migrations easier.\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  skipTrailingSlashRedirect: true,\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"middleware.js\"\nconst legacyPrefixes = ['/docs', '/blog']\n\nexport default async function middleware(req) {\n  const { pathname } = req.nextUrl\n\n  if (legacyPrefixes.some((prefix) => pathname.startsWith(prefix))) {\n    return NextResponse.next()\n  }\n\n  // apply trailing slash handling\n  if (\n    !pathname.endsWith('/') &&\n    !pathname.match(/((?!\\.well-known(?:\\/.*)?)(?:[^/]+\\/)*[^/]+\\.\\w+)/)\n  ) {\n    return NextResponse.redirect(\n      new URL(`${req.nextUrl.pathname}/`, req.nextUrl)\n    )\n  }\n}\n```\n\n`skipMiddlewareUrlNormalize` allows for disabling the URL normalization in Next.js to make handling direct visits and client-transitions the same. In some advanced cases, this option provides full control by using the original URL.\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  skipMiddlewareUrlNormalize: true,\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"middleware.js\"\nexport default async function middleware(req) {\n  const { pathname } = req.nextUrl\n\n  // GET /_next/data/build-id/hello.json\n\n  console.log(pathname)\n  // with the flag this now /_next/data/build-id/hello.json\n  // without the flag this would be normalized to /hello\n}\n```\n\n## Runtime\n\nMiddleware currently only supports the [Edge runtime](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/edge-and-nodejs-runtimes). The Node.js runtime can not be used.\n\n## Version History\n\n| Version   | Changes                                                                                       |\n| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `v13.1.0` | Advanced Middleware flags added                                                               |\n| `v13.0.0` | Middleware can modify request headers, response headers, and send responses                   |\n| `v12.2.0` | Middleware is stable, please see the [upgrade guide](/docs/messages/middleware-upgrade-guide) |\n| `v12.0.9` | Enforce absolute URLs in Edge Runtime ([PR](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/33410))    |\n| `v12.0.0` | Middleware (Beta) added                                                                       |\n"},{"path":"docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/07-configuring/03-environment-variables.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/07-configuring/03-environment-variables.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/environment-variables","sha":"b4c468f7c70af1acd48f0ae35ac9a3fd15f53e92","size":13371,"content":"---\ntitle: Environment Variables\ndescription: Learn to add and access environment variables in your Next.js application.\n---\n\n{/* The content of this doc is shared between the app and pages router.

For example:\n\n```tsx filename=\"orm.config.ts\" switcher\nimport './envConfig.ts'\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  dbCredentials: {\n    connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL!,\n  },\n})\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"orm.config.js\" switcher\nimport './envConfig.js'\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  dbCredentials: {\n    connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,\n  },\n})\n```\n\n### Referencing Other Variables\n\nNext.js will automatically expand variables that use `$` to reference other variables e.g. `$VARIABLE` inside of your `.env*` files. This allows you to reference other secrets. For example:\n\n```txt filename=\".env\"\nTWITTER_USER=nextjs\nTWITTER_URL=https://x.com/$TWITTER_USER\n```\n\nIn the above example, `process.env.TWITTER_URL` would be set to `https://x.com/nextjs`.\n\n> **Good to know**: If you need to use variable with a `$` in the actual value, it needs to be escaped e.g. `\\$`.\n\n## Bundling Environment Variables for the Browser\n\nNon-`NEXT_PUBLIC_` environment variables are only available in the Node.js environment, meaning they aren't accessible to the browser (the client runs in a different _environment_).\n\nIn order to make the value of an environment variable accessible in the browser, Next.js can \"inline\" a value, at build time, into the js bundle that is delivered to the client, replacing all references to `process.env.[variable]` with a hard-coded value. To tell it to do this, you just have to prefix the variable with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`. For example:\n\n```txt filename=\"Terminal\"\nNEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_ID=abcdefghijk\n```\n\nThis will tell Next.js to replace all references to `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_ID` in the Node.js environment with the value from the environment in which you run `next build`, allowing you to use it anywhere in your code. It will be inlined into any JavaScript sent to the browser.\n\n> **Note**: After being built, your app will no longer respond to changes to these environment variables. For instance, if you use a Heroku pipeline to promote slugs built in one environment to another environment, or if you build and deploy a single Docker image to multiple environments, all `NEXT_PUBLIC_` variables will be frozen with the value evaluated at build time, so these values need to be set appropriately when the project is built. If you need access to runtime environment values, you'll have to setup your own API to provide them to the client (either on demand or during initialization).\n\n```js filename=\"pages/index.js\"\nimport setupAnalyticsService from '../lib/my-analytics-service'\n\n// 'NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_ID' can be used here as it's prefixed by 'NEXT_PUBLIC_'.\n// It will be transformed at build time to `setupAnalyticsService('abcdefghijk')`.\nsetupAnalyticsService(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_ID)\n\nfunction HomePage() {\n  return <h1>Hello World</h1>\n}\n\nexport default HomePage\n```\n\nNote that dynamic lookups will _not_ be inlined, such as:\n\n```js\n// This will NOT be inlined, because it uses a variable\nconst varName = 'NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_ID'\nsetupAnalyticsService(process.env[varName])\n\n// This will NOT be inlined, because it uses a variable\nconst env = process.env\nsetupAnalyticsService(env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_ID)\n```\n\n### Runtime Environment Variables\n\nNext.js can support both build time and runtime environment variables.\n\n**By default, environment variables are only available on the server**. To expose an environment variable to the browser, it must be prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`. However, these public environment variables will be inlined into the JavaScript bundle during `next build`.\n\nTo read runtime environment variables, we recommend using `getServerSideProps` or [incrementally adopting the App Router](/docs/app/building-your-application/upgrading/app-router-migration). With the App Router, we can safely read environment variables on the server during dynamic rendering. This allows you to use a singular Docker image that can be promoted through multiple environments with different values.\n\n```jsx\nimport { unstable_noStore as noStore } from 'next/cache'\n\nexport default function Component() {\n  noStore()\n  // cookies(), headers(), and other dynamic functions\n  // will also opt into dynamic rendering, meaning\n  // this env variable is evaluated at runtime\n  const value = process.env.MY_VALUE\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n**Good to know:**\n\n- You can run code on server startup using the [`register` function](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/instrumentation).\n- We do not recommend using the [runtimeConfig](/docs/pages/api-reference/next-config-js/runtime-configuration) option, as this does not work with the standalone output mode. Instead, we recommend [incrementally adopting](/docs/app/building-your-application/upgrading/app-router-migration) the App Router.\n\n## Default Environment Variables\n\nTypically, only `.env*` file is needed. However, sometimes you might want to add some defaults for the `development` (`next dev`) or `production` (`next start`) environment.\n\nNext.js allows you to set defaults in `.env` (all environments), `.env.development` (development environment), and `.env.production` (production environment).\n\n> **Good to know**: `.env`, `.env.development`, and `.env.production` files should be included in your repository as they define defaults. All `.env` files are excluded in `.gitignore` by default, allowing you to opt-into committing these values to your repository.\n\n## Environment Variables on Vercel\n\nWhen deploying your Next.js application to [Vercel](https://vercel.com), Environment Variables can be configured [in the Project Settings](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables?utm_medium=docs&utm_source=next-site&utm_campaign=next-website).\n\nAll types of Environment Variables should be configured there. Even Environment Variables used in Development – which can be [downloaded onto your local device](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/environment-variables#development-environment-variables?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=next-website) afterwards.\n\nIf you've configured [Development Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/environment-variables#development-environment-variables?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=next-website) you can pull them into a `.env.local` for usage on your local machine using the following command:\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nvercel env pull\n```\n\n> **Good to know**: When deploying your Next.js application to [Vercel](https://vercel.com), your environment variables in `.env*` files will not be made available to Edge Runtime, unless their name are prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`. We strongly recommend managing your environment variables in [Project Settings](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables?utm_medium=docs&utm_source=next-site&utm_campaign=next-website) instead, from where all environment variables are available.\n\n## Test Environment Variables\n\nApart from `development` and `production` environments, there is a 3rd option available: `test`. In the same way you can set defaults for development or production environments, you can do the same with a `.env.test` file for the `testing` environment (though this one is not as common as the previous two). Next.js will not load environment variables from `.env.development` or `.env.production` in the `testing` environment.\n\nThis one is useful when running tests with tools like `jest` or `cypress` where you need to set specific environment vars only for testing purposes. Test default values will be loaded if `NODE_ENV` is set to `test`, though you usually don't need to do this manually as testing tools will address it for you.\n\nThere is a small difference between `test` environment, and both `development` and `production` that you need to bear in mind: `.env.local` won't be loaded, as you expect tests to produce the same results for everyone. This way every test execution will use the same env defaults across different executions by ignoring your `.env.local` (which is intended to override the default set).\n\n> **Good to know**: similar to Default Environment Variables, `.env.test` file should be included in your repository, but `.env.test.local` shouldn't, as `.env*.local` are intended to be ignored through `.gitignore`.\n\nWhile running unit tests you can make sure to load your environment variables the same way Next.js does by leveraging the `loadEnvConfig` function from the `@next/env` package.\n\n```js\n// The below can be used in a Jest global setup file or similar for your testing set-up\nimport { loadEnvConfig } from '@next/env'\n\nexport default async () => {\n  const projectDir = process.cwd()\n  loadEnvConfig(projectDir)\n}\n```\n\n## Environment Variable Load Order\n\nEnvironment variables are looked up in the following places, in order, stopping once the variable is found.\n\n1. `process.env`\n1. `.env.$(NODE_ENV).local`\n1. `.env.local` (Not checked when `NODE_ENV` is `test`.)\n1. `.env.$(NODE_ENV)`\n1. `.env`\n\nFor example, if `NODE_ENV` is `development` and you define a variable in both `.env.development.local` and `.env`, the value in `.env.development.local` will be used.\n\n> **Good to know**: The allowed values for `NODE_ENV` are `production`, `development` and `test`.\n\n## Good to know\n\n- If you are using a [`/src` directory](/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/src-directory), `.env.*` files should remain in the root of your project.\n- If the environment variable `NODE_ENV` is unassigned, Next.js automatically assigns `development` when running the `next dev` command, or `production` for all other commands.\n\n## Version History\n\n| Version  | Changes                                       |\n| -------- | --------------------------------------------- |\n| `v9.4.0` | Support `.env` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_` introduced. |\n"},{"path":"docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/07-configuring/04-absolute-imports-and-module-aliases.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/07-configuring/04-absolute-imports-and-module-aliases.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/absolute-imports-and-module-aliases","sha":"ff9a06d66795a7277377cecef3bd60e6117d8328","size":3474,"content":"---\ntitle: Absolute Imports and Module Path Aliases\ndescription: Configure module path aliases that allow you to remap certain import paths.\n---\n\n{/* The content of this doc is shared between the app and pages router.

For example:\n\n```tsx\n// before\nimport { Button } from '../../../components/button'\n\n// after\nimport { Button } from '@/components/button'\n```\n\n> **Good to know**: `create-next-app` will prompt to configure these options for you.\n\n## Absolute Imports\n\nThe `baseUrl` configuration option allows you to import directly from the root of the project.\n\nAn example of this configuration:\n\n```json filename=\"tsconfig.json or jsconfig.json\"\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"baseUrl\": \".\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```tsx filename=\"components/button.tsx\" switcher\nexport default function Button() {\n  return <button>Click me</button>\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"components/button.js\" switcher\nexport default function Button() {\n  return <button>Click me</button>\n}\n```\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/page.tsx\" switcher\nimport Button from 'components/button'\n\nexport default function HomePage() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h1>Hello World</h1>\n      <Button />\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/page.js\" switcher\nimport Button from 'components/button'\n\nexport default function HomePage() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h1>Hello World</h1>\n      <Button />\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n## Module Aliases\n\nIn addition to configuring the `baseUrl` path, you can use the `\"paths\"` option to \"alias\" module paths.\n\nFor example, the following configuration maps `@/components/*` to `components/*`:\n\n```json filename=\"tsconfig.json or jsconfig.json\"\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"baseUrl\": \".\",\n    \"paths\": {\n      \"@/components/*\": [\"components/*\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```tsx filename=\"components/button.tsx\" switcher\nexport default function Button() {\n  return <button>Click me</button>\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"components/button.js\" switcher\nexport default function Button() {\n  return <button>Click me</button>\n}\n```\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/page.tsx\" switcher\nimport Button from '@/components/button'\n\nexport default function HomePage() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h1>Hello World</h1>\n      <Button />\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/page.js\" switcher\nimport Button from '@/components/button'\n\nexport default function HomePage() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h1>Hello World</h1>\n      <Button />\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nEach of the `\"paths\"` are relative to the `baseUrl` location. For example:\n\n```json\n// tsconfig.json or jsconfig.json\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"baseUrl\": \"src/\",\n    \"paths\": {\n      \"@/styles/*\": [\"styles/*\"],\n      \"@/components/*\": [\"components/*\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```jsx\n// pages/index.js\nimport Button from '@/components/button'\nimport '@/styles/styles.css'\nimport Helper from 'utils/helper'\n\nexport default function HomePage() {\n  return (\n    <Helper>\n      <h1>Hello World</h1>\n      <Button />\n    </Helper>\n  )\n}\n```\n"},{"path":"docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/07-configuring/02-eslint.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/07-configuring/02-eslint.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/eslint","sha":"4926de6334050b5dbb6cb6d014b401cf6524e02b","size":17073,"content":"---\ntitle: ESLint\ndescription: Next.js provides an integrated ESLint experience by default.

Any shared content should not be wrapped in a component. */}\n\nNext.js provides an integrated [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) experience out of the box. Add `next lint` as a script to `package.json`:\n\n```json filename=\"package.json\"\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"lint\": \"next lint\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThen run `npm run lint` or `yarn lint`:\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nyarn lint\n```\n\nIf you don't already have ESLint configured in your application, you will be guided through the installation and configuration process.\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nyarn lint\n```\n\n> You'll see a prompt like this:\n>\n> ? How would you like to configure ESLint?\n>\n> ❯ Strict (recommended)  \n> Base  \n> Cancel\n\nOne of the following three options can be selected:\n\n- **Strict**: Includes Next.js' base ESLint configuration along with a stricter [Core Web Vitals rule-set](#core-web-vitals). This is the recommended configuration for developers setting up ESLint for the first time.\n\n  ```json filename=\".eslintrc.json\"\n  {\n    \"extends\": \"next/core-web-vitals\"\n  }\n  ```\n\n- **Base**: Includes Next.js' base ESLint configuration.\n\n  ```json filename=\".eslintrc.json\"\n  {\n    \"extends\": \"next\"\n  }\n  ```\n\n- **Cancel**: Does not include any ESLint configuration. Only select this option if you plan on setting up your own custom ESLint configuration.\n\nIf either of the two configuration options are selected, Next.js will automatically install `eslint` and `eslint-config-next` as dependencies in your application and create an `.eslintrc.json` file in the root of your project that includes your selected configuration.\n\nYou can now run `next lint` every time you want to run ESLint to catch errors. Once ESLint has been set up, it will also automatically run during every build (`next build`). Errors will fail the build, while warnings will not.\n\n<AppOnly>\n\n> If you do not want ESLint to run during `next build`, refer to the documentation for [Ignoring ESLint](/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/eslint).\n\n</AppOnly>\n\n<PagesOnly>\n\n> If you do not want ESLint to run during `next build`, refer to the documentation for [Ignoring ESLint](/docs/pages/api-reference/next-config-js/eslint).\n\n</PagesOnly>\n\nWe recommend using an appropriate [integration](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/integrations#editors) to view warnings and errors directly in your code editor during development.\n\n## ESLint Config\n\nThe default configuration (`eslint-config-next`) includes everything you need to have an optimal out-of-the-box linting experience in Next.js. If you do not have ESLint already configured in your application, we recommend using `next lint` to set up ESLint along with this configuration.\n\n> If you would like to use `eslint-config-next` along with other ESLint configurations, refer to the [Additional Configurations](#additional-configurations) section to learn how to do so without causing any conflicts.\n\nRecommended rule-sets from the following ESLint plugins are all used within `eslint-config-next`:\n\n- [`eslint-plugin-react`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react)\n- [`eslint-plugin-react-hooks`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react-hooks)\n- [`eslint-plugin-next`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@next/eslint-plugin-next)\n\nThis will take precedence over the configuration from `next.config.js`.\n\n## ESLint Plugin\n\nNext.js provides an ESLint plugin, [`eslint-plugin-next`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@next/eslint-plugin-next), already bundled within the base configuration that makes it possible to catch common issues and problems in a Next.js application.

configured in your application, we recommend extending from this plugin directly instead of including `eslint-config-next` unless a few conditions are met. Refer to the [Recommended Plugin Ruleset](#recommended-plugin-ruleset) to learn more.\n\n### Custom Settings\n\n#### `rootDir`\n\nIf you're using `eslint-plugin-next` in a project where Next.js isn't installed in your root directory (such as a monorepo), you can tell `eslint-plugin-next` where to find your Next.js application using the `settings` property in your `.eslintrc`:\n\n```json filename=\".eslintrc.json\"\n{\n  \"extends\": \"next\",\n  \"settings\": {\n    \"next\": {\n      \"rootDir\": \"packages/my-app/\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n`rootDir` can be a path (relative or absolute), a glob (i.e. `\"packages/*/\"`), or an array of paths and/or globs.\n\n## Linting Custom Directories and Files\n\nBy default, Next.js will run ESLint for all files in the `pages/`, `app/`, `components/`, `lib/`, and `src/` directories. However, you can specify which directories using the `dirs` option in the `eslint` config in `next.config.js` for production builds:\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  eslint: {\n    dirs: ['pages', 'utils'], // Only run ESLint on the 'pages' and 'utils' directories during production builds (next build)\n  },\n}\n```\n\nSimilarly, the `--dir` and `--file` flags can be used for `next lint` to lint specific directories and files:\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nnext lint --dir pages --dir utils --file bar.js\n```\n\n## Caching\n\n<AppOnly>\n\nTo improve performance, information of files processed by ESLint are cached by default. This is stored in `.next/cache` or in your defined [build directory](/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/distDir). If you include any ESLint rules that depend on more than the contents of a single source file and need to disable the cache, use the `--no-cache` flag with `next lint`.\n\n</AppOnly>\n\n<PagesOnly>\n\nTo improve performance, information of files processed by ESLint are cached by default. This is stored in `.next/cache` or in your defined [build directory](/docs/pages/api-reference/next-config-js/distDir). If you include any ESLint rules that depend on more than the contents of a single source file and need to disable the cache, use the `--no-cache` flag with `next lint`.\n\n</PagesOnly>\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nnext lint --no-cache\n```\n\n## Disabling Rules\n\nIf you would like to modify or disable any rules provided by the supported plugins (`react`, `react-hooks`, `next`), you can directly change them using the `rules` property in your `.eslintrc`:\n\n```json filename=\".eslintrc.json\"\n{\n  \"extends\": \"next\",\n  \"rules\": {\n    \"react/no-unescaped-entities\": \"off\",\n    \"@next/next/no-page-custom-font\": \"off\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Core Web Vitals\n\nThe `next/core-web-vitals` rule set is enabled when `next lint` is run for the first time and the **strict** option is selected.\n\n```json filename=\".eslintrc.json\"\n{\n  \"extends\": \"next/core-web-vitals\"\n}\n```\n\n`next/core-web-vitals` updates `eslint-plugin-next` to error on a number of rules that are warnings by default if they affect [Core Web Vitals](https://web.dev/vitals/).\n\n> The `next/core-web-vitals` entry point is automatically included for new applications built with [Create Next App](/docs/app/api-reference/create-next-app).\n\n## Usage With Other Tools\n\n### Prettier\n\nESLint also contains code formatting rules, which can conflict with your existing [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) setup. We recommend including [eslint-config-prettier](https://github.com/prettier/eslint-config-prettier) in your ESLint config to make ESLint and Prettier work together.\n\nFirst, install the dependency:\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nnpm install --save-dev eslint-config-prettier\n\nyarn add --dev eslint-config-prettier\n\npnpm add --save-dev eslint-config-prettier\n\nbun add --dev eslint-config-prettier\n```\n\nThen, add `prettier` to your existing ESLint config:\n\n```json filename=\".eslintrc.json\"\n{\n  \"extends\": [\"next\", \"prettier\"]\n}\n```\n\n### lint-staged\n\nIf you would like to use `next lint` with [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged) to run the linter on staged git files, you'll have to add the following to the `.lintstagedrc.js` file in the root of your project in order to specify usage of the `--file` flag.\n\n```js filename=\".lintstagedrc.js\"\nconst path = require('path')\n\nconst buildEslintCommand = (filenames) =>\n  `next lint --fix --file ${filenames\n    .map((f) => path.relative(process.cwd(), f))\n    .join(' --file ')}`\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  '*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}': [buildEslintCommand],\n}\n```\n\n## Migrating Existing Config\n\n### Recommended Plugin Ruleset\n\nIf you already have ESLint configured in your application and any of the following conditions are true:\n\n- You have one or more of the following plugins already installed (either separately or through a different config such as `airbnb` or `react-app`):\n  - `react`\n  - `react-hooks`\n  - `jsx-a11y`\n  - `import`\n- You've defined specific `parserOptions` that are different from how Babel is configured within Next.js (this is not recommended unless you have [customized your Babel configuration](/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/babel))\n- You have `eslint-plugin-import` installed with Node.js and/or TypeScript [resolvers](https://github.com/benmosher/eslint-plugin-import#resolvers) defined to handle imports\n\nThen we recommend either removing these settings if you prefer how these properties have been configured within [`eslint-config-next`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/packages/eslint-config-next/index.js) or extending directly from the Next.js ESLint plugin instead:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  extends: [\n    //...\n    'plugin:@next/next/recommended',\n  ],\n}\n```\n\nThe plugin can be installed normally in your project without needing to run `next lint`:\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nnpm install --save-dev @next/eslint-plugin-next\n\nyarn add --dev @next/eslint-plugin-next\n\npnpm add --save-dev @next/eslint-plugin-next\n\nbun add --dev @next/eslint-plugin-next\n```\n\nThis eliminates the risk of collisions or errors that can occur due to importing the same plugin or parser across multiple configurations.\n\n### Additional Configurations\n\nIf you already use a separate ESLint configuration and want to include `eslint-config-next`, ensure that it is extended last after other configurations. For example:\n\n```json filename=\".eslintrc.json\"\n{\n  \"extends\": [\"eslint:recommended\", \"next\"]\n}\n```\n\nThe `next` configuration already handles setting default values for the `parser`, `plugins` and `settings` properties. There is no need to manually re-declare any of these properties unless you need a different configuration for your use case.\n\nIf you include any other shareable configurations, **you will need to make sure that these properties are not overwritten or modified**. Otherwise, we recommend removing any configurations that share behavior with the `next` configuration or extending directly from the Next.js ESLint plugin as mentioned above.\n"},{"path":"docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/07-configuring/06-src-directory.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/07-configuring/06-src-directory.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/src-directory","sha":"1bc940a6c866d52e90c6a72babf0a0ee032b13f1","size":2050,"content":"---\ntitle: src Directory\ndescription: Save pages under the `src` directory as an alternative to the root `pages` directory.\nrelated:\n  links:\n    - app/building-your-application/routing/colocation\n---\n\n{/* The content of this doc is shared between the app and pages router.

Run `next dev` and `next build` to automatically install the necessary dependencies and add a `tsconfig.json` file with the recommended config options.\n\nIf you already had a `jsconfig.json` file, copy the `paths` compiler option from the old `jsconfig.json` into the new `tsconfig.json` file, and delete the old `jsconfig.json` file.\n\n<AppOnly>\n\n## TypeScript Plugin\n\nNext.js includes a custom TypeScript plugin and type checker, which VSCode and other code editors can use for advanced type-checking and auto-completion.\n\nYou can enable the plugin in VS Code by:\n\n1. Opening the command palette (`Ctrl/⌘` + `Shift` + `P`)\n2. Searching for \"TypeScript: Select TypeScript Version\"\n3. Selecting \"Use Workspace Version\"\n\n<Image\n  alt=\"TypeScript Command Palette\"\n  srcLight=\"/docs/light/typescript-command-palette.png\"\n  srcDark=\"/docs/dark/typescript-command-palette.png\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"637\"\n/>\n\nNow, when editing files, the custom plugin will be enabled. When running `next build`, the custom type checker will be used.\n\n### Plugin Features\n\nThe TypeScript plugin can help with:\n\n- Warning if the invalid values for [segment config options](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/route-segment-config) are passed.\n- Showing available options and in-context documentation.\n- Ensuring the `use client` directive is used correctly.\n- Ensuring client hooks (like `useState`) are only used in Client Components.\n\n> **Good to know**: More features will be added in the future.\n\n</AppOnly>\n\n## Minimum TypeScript Version\n\nIt is highly recommended to be on at least `v4.5.2` of TypeScript to get syntax features such as [type modifiers on import names](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-5/#type-on-import-names) and [performance improvements](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-5/#real-path-sync-native).\n\n<AppOnly>\n\n## Statically Typed Links\n\nNext.js can statically type links to prevent typos and other errors when using `next/link`, improving type safety when navigating between pages.\n\nTo opt-into this feature, `experimental.typedRoutes` need to be enabled and the project needs to be using TypeScript.\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\n/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */\nconst nextConfig = {\n  experimental: {\n    typedRoutes: true,\n  },\n}\n\nmodule.exports = nextConfig\n```\n\nNext.js will generate a link definition in `.next/types` that contains information about all existing routes in your application, which TypeScript can then use to provide feedback in your editor about invalid links.\n\nCurrently, experimental support includes any string literal, including dynamic segments. For non-literal strings, you currently need to manually cast the `href` with `as Route`:\n\n```tsx\nimport type { Route } from 'next';\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n\n// No TypeScript errors if href is a valid route\n<Link href=\"/about\" />\n<Link href=\"/blog/nextjs\" />\n<Link href={`/blog/${slug}`} />\n<Link href={('/blog' + slug) as Route} />\n\n// TypeScript errors if href is not a valid route\n<Link href=\"/aboot\" />\n```\n\nTo accept `href` in a custom component wrapping `next/link`, use a generic:\n\n```tsx\nimport type { Route } from 'next'\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n\nfunction Card<T extends string>({ href }: { href: Route<T> | URL }) {\n  return (\n    <Link href={href}>\n      <div>My Card</div>\n    </Link>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n> **How does it work?**\n>\n> When running `next dev` or `next build`, Next.js generates a hidden `.d.ts` file inside `.next` that contains information about all existing routes in your application (all valid routes as the `href` type of `Link`). This `.d.ts` file is included in `tsconfig.json` and the TypeScript compiler will check that `.d.ts` and provide feedback in your editor about invalid links.\n\n## End-to-End Type Safety\n\nThe Next.js App Router has **enhanced type safety**. This includes:\n\n1. **No serialization of data between fetching function and page**: You can `fetch` directly in components, layouts, and pages on the server. This data _does not_ need to be serialized (converted to a string) to be passed to the client side for consumption in React. Instead, since `app` uses Server Components by default, we can use values like `Date`, `Map`, `Set`, and more without any extra steps. Previously, you needed to manually type the boundary between server and client with Next.js-specific types.\n2. **Streamlined data flow between components**: With the removal of `_app` in favor of root layouts, it is now easier to visualize the data flow between components and pages. Previously, data flowing between individual `pages` and `_app` were difficult to type and could introduce confusing bugs. With [colocated data fetching](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/caching-and-revalidating) in the App Router, this is no longer an issue.\n\n[Data Fetching in Next.js](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/caching-and-revalidating) now provides as close to end-to-end type safety as possible without being prescriptive about your database or content provider selection.\n\nWe're able to type the response data as you would expect with normal TypeScript. For example:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/page.tsx\"\nasync function getData() {\n  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/...')\n  // The return value is *not* serialized\n  // You can return Date, Map, Set, etc.\n  return res.json()\n}\n\nexport default async function Page() {\n  const name = await getData()\n\n  return '...'\n}\n```\n\nFor _complete_ end-to-end type safety, this also requires your database or content provider to support TypeScript. This could be through using an [ORM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object%E2%80%93relational_mapping) or type-safe query builder.\n\n## Async Server Component TypeScript Error\n\nTo use an `async` Server Component with TypeScript, ensure you are using TypeScript `5.1.3` or higher and `@types/react` `18.2.8` or higher.\n\nIf you are using an older version of TypeScript, you may see a `'Promise<Element>' is not a valid JSX element` type error. Updating to the latest version of TypeScript and `@types/react` should resolve this issue.\n\n## Passing Data Between Server & Client Components\n\nWhen passing data between a Server and Client Component through props, the data is still serialized (converted to a string) for use in the browser. However, it does not need a special type. It’s typed the same as passing any other props between components.\n\nFurther, there is less code to be serialized, as un-rendered data does not cross between the server and client (it remains on the server). This is only now possible through support for Server Components.\n\n</AppOnly>\n\n<PagesOnly>\n\n## Static Generation and Server-side Rendering\n\nFor [`getStaticProps`](/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/get-static-props), [`getStaticPaths`](/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/get-static-paths), and [`getServerSideProps`](/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/get-server-side-props), you can use the `GetStaticProps`, `GetStaticPaths`, and `GetServerSideProps` types respectively:\n\n```tsx filename=\"pages/blog/[slug].tsx\"\nimport type { GetStaticProps, GetStaticPaths, GetServerSideProps } from 'next'\n\nexport const getStaticProps = (async (context) => {\n  // ...\n}) satisfies GetStaticProps\n\nexport const getStaticPaths = (async () => {\n  // ...\n}) satisfies GetStaticPaths\n\nexport const getServerSideProps = (async (context) => {\n  // ...\n}) satisfies GetServerSideProps\n```\n\n> **Good to know:** `satisfies` was added to TypeScript in [4.9](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-4-9.html). We recommend upgrading to the latest version of TypeScript.\n\n## API Routes\n\nThe following is an example of how to use the built-in types for API routes:\n\n```ts\nimport type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next'\n\nexport default function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {\n  res.status(200).json({ name: 'John Doe' })\n}\n```\n\nYou can also type the response data:\n\n```ts\nimport type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next'\n\ntype Data = {\n  name: string\n}\n\nexport default function handler(\n  req: NextApiRequest,\n  res: NextApiResponse<Data>\n) {\n  res.status(200).json({ name: 'John Doe' })\n}\n```\n\n## Custom `App`\n\nIf you have a [custom `App`](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/custom-app), you can use the built-in type `AppProps` and change file name to `./pages/_app.tsx` like so:\n\n```ts\nimport type { AppProps } from 'next/app'\n\nexport default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {\n  return <Component {...pageProps} />\n}\n```\n\n</PagesOnly>\n\n## Path aliases and baseUrl\n\nNext.js automatically supports the `tsconfig.json` `\"paths\"` and `\"baseUrl\"` options.\n\n<AppOnly>\n\nYou can learn more about this feature on the [Module Path aliases documentation](/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/absolute-imports-and-module-aliases).\n\n</AppOnly>\n\n<PagesOnly>\n\nYou can learn more about this feature on the [Module Path aliases documentation](/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/absolute-imports-and-module-aliases).\n\n</PagesOnly>\n\n## Type checking next.config.js\n\nThe `next.config.js` file must be a JavaScript file as it does not get parsed by Babel or TypeScript, however you can add some type checking in your IDE using JSDoc as below:\n\n```js\n// @ts-check\n\n/**\n * @type {import('next').NextConfig}\n **/\nconst nextConfig = {\n  /* config options here */\n}\n\nmodule.exports = nextConfig\n```\n\n## Incremental type checking\n\nSince `v10.2.1` Next.js supports [incremental type checking](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#incremental) when enabled in your `tsconfig.json`, this can help speed up type checking in larger applications.\n\n## Ignoring TypeScript Errors\n\nNext.js fails your **production build** (`next build`) when TypeScript errors are present in your project.\n\nIf you'd like Next.js to dangerously produce production code even when your application has errors, you can disable the built-in type checking step.\n\nIf disabled, be sure you are running type checks as part of your build or deploy process, otherwise this can be very dangerous.\n\nOpen `next.config.js` and enable the `ignoreBuildErrors` option in the `typescript` config:\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  typescript: {\n    // !! WARN !!\n    // Dangerously allow production builds to successfully complete even if\n    // your project has type errors.\n    // !! WARN !!\n    ignoreBuildErrors: true,\n  },\n}\n```\n\n## Custom Type Declarations\n\nWhen you need to declare custom types, you might be tempted to modify `next-env.d.ts`. However, this file is automatically generated, so any changes you make will be overwritten. Instead, you should create a new file, let's call it `new-types.d.ts`, and reference it in your `tsconfig.json`:\n\n```json filename=\"tsconfig.json\"\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"skipLibCheck\": true\n    //...truncated...\n  },\n  \"include\": [\n    \"new-types.d.ts\",\n    \"next-env.d.ts\",\n    \".next/types/**/*.ts\",\n    \"**/*.ts\",\n    \"**/*.tsx\"\n  ],\n  \"exclude\": [\"node_modules\"]\n}\n```\n\n## Version Changes\n\n| Version   | Changes                                                                                                                              |\n| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| `v13.2.0` | Statically typed links are available in beta.                                                                                        |\n| `v12.0.0` | [SWC](/docs/architecture/nextjs-compiler) is now used by default to compile TypeScript and TSX for faster builds.                    |\n| `v10.2.1` | [Incremental type checking](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#incremental) support added when enabled in your `tsconfig.json`. |\n"},{"path":"docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/07-configuring/index.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/07-configuring/index.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring","sha":"1cbae5fdfb2662b1dde62c9cc18ef2dddfc7630b","size":568,"content":"---\ntitle: Configuring\ndescription: Learn how to configure your Next.js application.\n---\n\n{/* The content of this doc is shared between the app and pages router.

The Next.js plugin handles transforming markdown and React components into HTML, including support for usage in Server Components (the default in App Router).\n\n> **Good to know**: View the [Portfolio Starter Kit](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/portfolio-starter-kit) template for a complete working example.\n\n## Install dependencies\n\nThe `@next/mdx` package, and related packages, are used to configure Next.js so it can process markdown and MDX. **It sources data from local files**, allowing you to create pages with a `.md` or `.mdx` extension, directly in your `/pages` or `/app` directory.\n\nInstall these packages to render MDX with Next.js:\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nnpm install @next/mdx @mdx-js/loader @mdx-js/react @types/mdx\n```\n\n## Configure `next.config.mjs`\n\nUpdate the `next.config.mjs` file at your project's root to configure it to use MDX:\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.mjs\"\nimport createMDX from '@next/mdx'\n\n/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */\nconst nextConfig = {\n  // Configure `pageExtensions` to include markdown and MDX files\n  pageExtensions: ['js', 'jsx', 'md', 'mdx', 'ts', 'tsx'],\n  // Optionally, add any other Next.js config below\n}\n\nconst withMDX = createMDX({\n  // Add markdown plugins here, as desired\n})\n\n// Merge MDX config with Next.js config\nexport default withMDX(nextConfig)\n```\n\nThis allows `.md` and `.mdx` files to act as pages, routes, or imports in your application.\n\n## Add a `mdx-components.tsx` file\n\nCreate a `mdx-components.tsx` (or `.js`) file in the root of your project to define global MDX Components. For example, at the same level as `pages` or `app`, or inside `src` if applicable.\n\n```tsx filename=\"mdx-components.tsx\" switcher\nimport type { MDXComponents } from 'mdx/types'\n\nexport function useMDXComponents(components: MDXComponents): MDXComponents {\n  return {\n    ...components,\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"mdx-components.js\" switcher\nexport function useMDXComponents(components) {\n  return {\n    ...components,\n  }\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know**:\n>\n> - `mdx-components.tsx` is **required** to use `@next/mdx` with App Router and will not work without it.\n> - Learn more about the [`mdx-components.tsx` file convention](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/mdx-components).\n> - Learn how to [use custom styles and components](#using-custom-styles-and-components).\n\n## Rendering MDX\n\nYou can render MDX using Next.js's file based routing or by importing MDX files into other pages.\n\n### Using file based routing\n\nWhen using file based routing, you can use MDX pages like any other page.\n\n<AppOnly>\n\nIn App Router apps, that includes being able to use [metadata](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/metadata).\n\nCreate a new MDX page within the `/app` directory:\n\n```txt\n  my-project\n  ├── app\n  │   └── mdx-page\n  │       └── page.(mdx/md)\n  |── mdx-components.(tsx/js)\n  └── package.json\n```\n\n</AppOnly>\n\n<PagesOnly>\n\nCreate a new MDX page within the `/pages` directory:\n\n```txt\n  my-project\n  |── mdx-components.(tsx/js)\n  ├── pages\n  │   └── mdx-page.(mdx/md)\n  └── package.json\n```\n\n</PagesOnly>\n\nYou can use MDX in these files, and even import React components, directly inside your MDX page:\n\n```mdx\nimport { MyComponent } from 'my-component'\n\n# Welcome to my MDX page!\n\nThis is some **bold** and _italics_ text.\n\nThis is a list in markdown:\n\n- One\n- Two\n- Three\n\nCheckout my React component:\n\n<MyComponent />\n```\n\nNavigating to the `/mdx-page` route should display your rendered MDX page.\n\n### Using imports\n\n<AppOnly>\n\nCreate a new page within the `/app` directory and an MDX file wherever you'd like:\n\n```txt\n  my-project\n  ├── app\n  │   └── mdx-page\n  │       └── page.(tsx/js)\n  ├── markdown\n  │   └── welcome.(mdx/md)\n  |── mdx-components.(tsx/js)\n  └── package.json\n```\n\n</AppOnly>\n\n<PagesOnly>\n\nCreate a new page within the `/pages` directory and an MDX file wherever you'd like:\n\n```txt\n  my-project\n  ├── pages\n  │   └── mdx-page.(tsx/js)\n  ├── markdown\n  │   └── welcome.(mdx/md)\n  |── mdx-components.(tsx/js)\n  └── package.json\n```\n\n</PagesOnly>\n\nYou can use MDX in these files, and even import React components, directly inside your MDX page:\n\n```mdx filename=\"markdown/welcome.mdx\" switcher\nimport { MyComponent } from 'my-component'\n\n# Welcome to my MDX page!\n\nThis is some **bold** and _italics_ text.\n\nThis is a list in markdown:\n\n- One\n- Two\n- Three\n\nCheckout my React component:\n\n<MyComponent />\n```\n\nImport the MDX file inside the page to display the content:\n\n<AppOnly>\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/mdx-page/page.tsx\" switcher\nimport Welcome from '@/markdown/welcome.mdx'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return <Welcome />\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/mdx-page/page.js\" switcher\nimport Welcome from '@/markdown/welcome.mdx'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return <Welcome />\n}\n```\n\n</AppOnly>\n\n<PagesOnly>\n\n```tsx filename=\"pages/mdx-page.tsx\" switcher\nimport Welcome from '@/markdown/welcome.mdx'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return <Welcome />\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"pages/mdx-page.js\" switcher\nimport Welcome from '@/markdown/welcome.mdx'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return <Welcome />\n}\n```\n\n</PagesOnly>\n\nNavigating to the `/mdx-page` route should display your rendered MDX page.\n\n## Using custom styles and components\n\nMarkdown, when rendered, maps to native HTML elements. For example, writing the following markdown:\n\n```md\n## This is a heading\n\nThis is a list in markdown:\n\n- One\n- Two\n- Three\n```\n\nGenerates the following HTML:\n\n```html\n<h2>This is a heading</h2>\n\n<p>This is a list in markdown:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>One</li>\n  <li>Two</li>\n  <li>Three</li>\n</ul>\n```\n\nTo style your markdown, you can provide custom components that map to the generated HTML elements. Styles and components can be implemented globally, locally, and with shared layouts.\n\n### Global styles and components\n\nAdding styles and components in `mdx-components.tsx` will affect _all_ MDX files in your application.\n\n```tsx filename=\"mdx-components.tsx\" switcher\nimport type { MDXComponents } from 'mdx/types'\nimport Image, { ImageProps } from 'next/image'\n\n// This file allows you to provide custom React components\n// to be used in MDX files. You can import and use any\n// React component you want, including inline styles,\n// components from other libraries, and more.\n\nexport function useMDXComponents(components: MDXComponents): MDXComponents {\n  return {\n    // Allows customizing built-in components, e.g. to add styling.\n    h1: ({ children }) => (\n      <h1 style={{ color: 'red', fontSize: '48px' }}>{children}</h1>\n    ),\n    img: (props) => (\n      <Image\n        sizes=\"100vw\"\n        style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }}\n        {...(props as ImageProps)}\n      />\n    ),\n    ...components,\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"mdx-components.js\" switcher\nimport Image from 'next/image'\n\n// This file allows you to provide custom React components\n// to be used in MDX files. You can import and use any\n// React component you want, including inline styles,\n// components from other libraries, and more.\n\nexport function useMDXComponents(components) {\n  return {\n    // Allows customizing built-in components, e.g. to add styling.\n    h1: ({ children }) => (\n      <h1 style={{ color: 'red', fontSize: '48px' }}>{children}</h1>\n    ),\n    img: (props) => (\n      <Image\n        sizes=\"100vw\"\n        style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }}\n        {...props}\n      />\n    ),\n    ...components,\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Local styles and components\n\nYou can apply local styles and components to specific pages by passing them into imported MDX components. These will merge with and override [global styles and components](#global-styles-and-components).\n\n<AppOnly>\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/mdx-page/page.tsx\" switcher\nimport Welcome from '@/markdown/welcome.mdx'\n\nfunction CustomH1({ children }) {\n  return <h1 style={{ color: 'blue', fontSize: '100px' }}>{children}</h1>\n}\n\nconst overrideComponents = {\n  h1: CustomH1,\n}\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return <Welcome components={overrideComponents} />\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/mdx-page/page.js\" switcher\nimport Welcome from '@/markdown/welcome.mdx'\n\nfunction CustomH1({ children }) {\n  return <h1 style={{ color: 'blue', fontSize: '100px' }}>{children}</h1>\n}\n\nconst overrideComponents = {\n  h1: CustomH1,\n}\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return <Welcome components={overrideComponents} />\n}\n```\n\n</AppOnly>\n\n<PagesOnly>\n\n```tsx filename=\"pages/mdx-page.tsx\" switcher\nimport Welcome from '@/markdown/welcome.mdx'\n\nfunction CustomH1({ children }) {\n  return <h1 style={{ color: 'blue', fontSize: '100px' }}>{children}</h1>\n}\n\nconst overrideComponents = {\n  h1: CustomH1,\n}\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return <Welcome components={overrideComponents} />\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"pages/mdx-page.js\" switcher\nimport Welcome from '@/markdown/welcome.mdx'\n\nfunction CustomH1({ children }) {\n  return <h1 style={{ color: 'blue', fontSize: '100px' }}>{children}</h1>\n}\n\nconst overrideComponents = {\n  h1: CustomH1,\n}\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return <Welcome components={overrideComponents} />\n}\n```\n\n</PagesOnly>\n\n### Shared layouts\n\n<AppOnly>\n\nTo share a layout across MDX pages, you can use the [built-in layouts support](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/layouts-and-templates#layouts) with the App Router.\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/mdx-page/layout.tsx\" switcher\nexport default function MdxLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {\n  // Create any shared layout or styles here\n  return <div style={{ color: 'blue' }}>{children}</div>\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/mdx-page/layout.js\" switcher\nexport default function MdxLayout({ children }) {\n  // Create any shared layout or styles here\n  return <div style={{ color: 'blue' }}>{children}</div>\n}\n```\n\n</AppOnly>\n\n<PagesOnly>\n\nTo share a layout around MDX pages, create a layout component:\n\n```tsx filename=\"components/mdx-layout.tsx\" switcher\nexport default function MdxLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {\n  // Create any shared layout or styles here\n  return <div style={{ color: 'blue' }}>{children}</div>\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"components/mdx-layout.js\" switcher\nexport default function MdxLayout({ children }) {\n  // Create any shared layout or styles here\n  return <div style={{ color: 'blue' }}>{children}</div>\n}\n```\n\nThen, import the layout component into the MDX page, wrap the MDX content in the layout, and export it:\n\n```mdx\nimport MdxLayout from '../components/mdx-layout'\n\n# Welcome to my MDX page!\n\nexport default function MDXPage({ children }) {\n  return <MdxLayout>{children}</MdxLayout>\n\n}\n```\n\n</PagesOnly>\n\n### Using Tailwind typography plugin\n\nIf you are using [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) to style your application, using the [`@tailwindcss/typography` plugin](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/plugins#typography) will allow you to reuse your Tailwind configuration and styles in your markdown files.\n\nThe plugin adds a set of `prose` classes that can be used to add typographic styles to content blocks that come from sources, like markdown.\n\n[Install Tailwind typography](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-typography?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) and use with [shared layouts](#shared-layouts) to add the `prose` you want.\n\n<AppOnly>\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/mdx-page/layout.tsx\" switcher\nexport default function MdxLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {\n  // Create any shared layout or styles here\n  return (\n    <div className=\"prose prose-headings:mt-8 prose-headings:font-semibold prose-headings:text-black prose-h1:text-5xl prose-h2:text-4xl prose-h3:text-3xl prose-h4:text-2xl prose-h5:text-xl prose-h6:text-lg dark:prose-headings:text-white\">\n      {children}\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/mdx-page/layout.js\" switcher\nexport default function MdxLayout({ children }) {\n  // Create any shared layout or styles here\n  return (\n    <div className=\"prose prose-headings:mt-8 prose-headings:font-semibold prose-headings:text-black prose-h1:text-5xl prose-h2:text-4xl prose-h3:text-3xl prose-h4:text-2xl prose-h5:text-xl prose-h6:text-lg dark:prose-headings:text-white\">\n      {children}\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n</AppOnly>\n\n<PagesOnly>\n\nTo share a layout around MDX pages, create a layout component:\n\n```tsx filename=\"components/mdx-layout.tsx\" switcher\nexport default function MdxLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {\n  // Create any shared layout or styles here\n  return (\n    <div className=\"prose prose-headings:mt-8 prose-headings:font-semibold prose-headings:text-black prose-h1:text-5xl prose-h2:text-4xl prose-h3:text-3xl prose-h4:text-2xl prose-h5:text-xl prose-h6:text-lg dark:prose-headings:text-white\">\n      {children}\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"components/mdx-layout.js\" switcher\nexport default function MdxLayout({ children }) {\n  // Create any shared layout or styles here\n  return (\n    <div className=\"prose prose-headings:mt-8 prose-headings:font-semibold prose-headings:text-black prose-h1:text-5xl prose-h2:text-4xl prose-h3:text-3xl prose-h4:text-2xl prose-h5:text-xl prose-h6:text-lg dark:prose-headings:text-white\">\n      {children}\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nThen, import the layout component into the MDX page, wrap the MDX content in the layout, and export it:\n\n```mdx\nimport MdxLayout from '../components/mdx-layout'\n\n# Welcome to my MDX page!\n\nexport default function MDXPage({ children }) {\n  return <MdxLayout>{children}</MdxLayout>\n\n}\n```\n\n</PagesOnly >\n\n## Frontmatter\n\nFrontmatter is a YAML like key/value pairing that can be used to store data about a page. `@next/mdx` does **not** support frontmatter by default, though there are many solutions for adding frontmatter to your MDX content, such as:\n\n- [remark-frontmatter](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-frontmatter)\n- [remark-mdx-frontmatter](https://github.com/remcohaszing/remark-mdx-frontmatter)\n- [gray-matter](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/gray-matter)\n\n`@next/mdx` **does** allow you to use exports like any other JavaScript component:\n\n```mdx filename=\"content/blog-post.mdx\" switcher\nexport const metadata = {\n  author: 'John Doe',\n}\n\n# Blog post\n```\n\nMetadata can now be referenced outside of the MDX file:\n\n<AppOnly>\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/blog/page.tsx\" switcher\nimport BlogPost, { metadata } from '@/content/blog-post.mdx'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  console.log('metadata': metadata)\n  //=> { author: 'John Doe' }\n  return <BlogPost />\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/blog/page.js\" switcher\nimport BlogPost, { metadata } from '@/content/blog-post.mdx'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  console.log('metadata': metadata)\n  //=> { author: 'John Doe' }\n  return <BlogPost />\n}\n```\n\n</AppOnly>\n\n<PagesOnly>\n\n```tsx filename=\"pages/blog.tsx\" switcher\nimport BlogPost, { metadata } from '@/content/blog-post.mdx'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  console.log('metadata': metadata)\n  //=> { author: 'John Doe' }\n  return <BlogPost />\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"pages/blog.js\" switcher\nimport BlogPost, { metadata } from '@/content/blog-post.mdx'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  console.log('metadata': metadata)\n  //=> { author: 'John Doe' }\n  return <BlogPost />\n}\n```\n\n</PagesOnly>\n\nA common use case for this is when you want to iterate over a collection of MDX and extract data. For example, creating a blog index page from all blog posts. You can use packages like [Node's `fs` module](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html) or [globby](https://www.npmjs.com/package/globby) to read a directory of posts and extract the metadata.\n\n> **Good to know**:\n>\n> - Using `fs`, `globby`, etc. can only be used server-side.\n> - View the [Portfolio Starter Kit](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/portfolio-starter-kit) template for a complete working example.\n\n## Remark and Rehype Plugins\n\nYou can optionally provide `remark` and `rehype` plugins to transform the MDX content.\n\nFor example, you can use `remark-gfm` to support GitHub Flavored Markdown.\n\nSince the `remark` and `rehype` ecosystem is ESM only, you'll need to use `next.config.mjs` as the configuration file.\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.mjs\"\nimport remarkGfm from 'remark-gfm'\nimport createMDX from '@next/mdx'\n\n/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */\nconst nextConfig = {\n  // Configure `pageExtensions`` to include MDX files\n  pageExtensions: ['js', 'jsx', 'md', 'mdx', 'ts', 'tsx'],\n  // Optionally, add any other Next.js config below\n}\n\nconst withMDX = createMDX({\n  // Add markdown plugins here, as desired\n  options: {\n    remarkPlugins: [remarkGfm],\n    rehypePlugins: [],\n  },\n})\n\n// Wrap MDX and Next.js config with each other\nexport default withMDX(nextConfig)\n```\n\n## Remote MDX\n\nIf your MDX files or content lives _somewhere else_, you can fetch it dynamically on the server. This is useful for content stored in a separate local folder, CMS, database, or anywhere else. A popular community package for this use is [`next-mdx-remote`](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote#react-server-components-rsc--nextjs-app-directory-support).\n\n> **Good to know**: Please proceed with caution. MDX compiles to JavaScript and is executed on the server. You should only fetch MDX content from a trusted source, otherwise this can lead to remote code execution (RCE).\n\nThe following example uses `next-mdx-remote`:\n\n<AppOnly>\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/mdx-page-remote/page.tsx\" switcher\nimport { MDXRemote } from 'next-mdx-remote/rsc'\n\nexport default async function RemoteMdxPage() {\n  // MDX text - can be from a local file, database, CMS, fetch, anywhere...\n  const res = await fetch('https://...')\n  const markdown = await res.text()\n  return <MDXRemote source={markdown} />\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/mdx-page-remote/page.js\" switcher\nimport { MDXRemote } from 'next-mdx-remote/rsc'\n\nexport default async function RemoteMdxPage() {\n  // MDX text - can be from a local file, database, CMS, fetch, anywhere...\n  const res = await fetch('https://...')\n  const markdown = await res.text()\n  return <MDXRemote source={markdown} />\n}\n```\n\n</AppOnly>\n\n<PagesOnly>\n\n```tsx filename=\"pages/mdx-page-remote.tsx\" switcher\nimport { serialize } from 'next-mdx-remote/serialize'\nimport { MDXRemote, MDXRemoteSerializeResult } from 'next-mdx-remote'\n\ninterface Props {\n  mdxSource: MDXRemoteSerializeResult\n}\n\nexport default function RemoteMdxPage({ mdxSource }: Props) {\n  return <MDXRemote {...mdxSource} />\n}\n\nexport async function getStaticProps() {\n  // MDX text - can be from a local file, database, CMS, fetch, anywhere...\n  const res = await fetch('https:...')\n  const mdxText = await res.text()\n  const mdxSource = await serialize(mdxText)\n  return { props: { mdxSource } }\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"pages/mdx-page-remote.js\" switcher\nimport { serialize } from 'next-mdx-remote/serialize'\nimport { MDXRemote } from 'next-mdx-remote'\n\nexport default function RemoteMdxPage({ mdxSource }) {\n  return <MDXRemote {...mdxSource} />\n}\n\nexport async function getStaticProps() {\n  // MDX text - can be from a local file, database, CMS, fetch, anywhere...\n  const res = await fetch('https:...')\n  const mdxText = await res.text()\n  const mdxSource = await serialize(mdxText)\n  return { props: { mdxSource } }\n}\n```\n\n</PagesOnly>\n\nNavigating to the `/mdx-page-remote` route should display your rendered MDX.\n\n## Deep Dive: How do you transform markdown into HTML?\n\nReact does not natively understand markdown. The markdown plaintext needs to first be transformed into HTML. This can be accomplished with `remark` and `rehype`.\n\n`remark` is an ecosystem of tools around markdown. `rehype` is the same, but for HTML. For example, the following code snippet transforms markdown into HTML:\n\n```js\nimport { unified } from 'unified'\nimport remarkParse from 'remark-parse'\nimport remarkRehype from 'remark-rehype'\nimport rehypeSanitize from 'rehype-sanitize'\nimport rehypeStringify from 'rehype-stringify'\n\nmain()\n\nasync function main() {\n  const file = await unified()\n    .use(remarkParse) // Convert into markdown AST\n    .use(remarkRehype) // Transform to HTML AST\n    .use(rehypeSanitize) // Sanitize HTML input\n    .use(rehypeStringify) // Convert AST into serialized HTML\n    .process('Hello, Next.js!')\n\n  console.log(String(file)) // <p>Hello, Next.js!</p>\n}\n```\n\nThe `remark` and `rehype` ecosystem contains plugins for [syntax highlighting](https://github.com/atomiks/rehype-pretty-code), [linking headings](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-autolink-headings), [generating a table of contents](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-toc), and more.\n\nWhen using `@next/mdx` as shown above, you **do not** need to use `remark` or `rehype` directly, as it is handled for you. We're describing it here for a deeper understanding of what the `@next/mdx` package is doing underneath.\n\n## Using the Rust-based MDX compiler (Experimental)\n\nNext.js supports a new MDX compiler written in Rust. This compiler is still experimental and is not recommended for production use. To use the new compiler, you need to configure `next.config.js` when you pass it to `withMDX`:\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = withMDX({\n  experimental: {\n    mdxRs: true,\n  },\n})\n```\n\n`mdxRs` also accepts an object to configure how to transform mdx files.\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = withMDX({\n  experimental: {\n    mdxRs: {\n      jsxRuntime?: string            // Custom jsx runtime\n      jsxImportSource?: string       // Custom jsx import source,\n      mdxType?: 'gfm' | 'commonmark' // Configure what kind of mdx syntax will be used to parse & transform\n    },\n  },\n})\n```\n\n## Helpful Links\n\n- [MDX](https://mdxjs.com)\n- [`@next/mdx`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@next/mdx)\n- [remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark)\n- [rehype](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype)\n- [Markdoc](https://markdoc.dev/docs/nextjs)\n"},{"path":"docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/07-configuring/11-draft-mode.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/07-configuring/11-draft-mode.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/draft-mode","sha":"fee480698a4907ed9625a518d36d0cc80818a1df","size":9074,"content":"---\ntitle: Draft Mode\ndescription: Next.js has draft mode to toggle between static and dynamic pages. You can learn how it works with App Router here.\n---\n\nStatic rendering is useful when your pages fetch data from a headless CMS. However, it’s not ideal when you’re writing a draft on your headless CMS and want to view the draft immediately on your page. You’d want Next.js to render these pages at **request time** instead of build time and fetch the draft content instead of the published content. You’d want Next.js to switch to [dynamic rendering](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components#dynamic-rendering) only for this specific case.\n\nNext.js has a feature called **Draft Mode** which solves this problem. Here are instructions on how to use it.\n\n## Step 1: Create and access the Route Handler\n\nFirst, create a [Route Handler](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-handlers). It can have any name - e.g. `app/api/draft/route.ts`\n\nThen, import `draftMode` from `next/headers` and call the `enable()` method.\n\n```ts filename=\"app/api/draft/route.ts\" switcher\n// route handler enabling draft mode\nimport { draftMode } from 'next/headers'\n\nexport async function GET(request: Request) {\n  draftMode().enable()\n  return new Response('Draft mode is enabled')\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"app/api/draft/route.js\" switcher\n// route handler enabling draft mode\nimport { draftMode } from 'next/headers'\n\nexport async function GET(request) {\n  draftMode().enable()\n  return new Response('Draft mode is enabled')\n}\n```\n\nThis will set a **cookie** to enable draft mode. Subsequent requests containing this cookie will trigger **Draft Mode** changing the behavior for statically generated pages (more on this later).\n\nYou can test this manually by visiting `/api/draft` and looking at your browser’s developer tools. Notice the `Set-Cookie` response header with a cookie named `__prerender_bypass`.\n\n### Securely accessing it from your Headless CMS\n\nIn practice, you’d want to call this Route Handler _securely_ from your headless CMS. The specific steps will vary depending on which headless CMS you’re using, but here are some common steps you could take.\n\nThese steps assume that the headless CMS you’re using supports setting **custom draft URLs**. If it doesn’t, you can still use this method to secure your draft URLs, but you’ll need to construct and access the draft URL manually.\n\n**First**, you should create a **secret token string** using a token generator of your choice. This secret will only be known by your Next.js app and your headless CMS. This secret prevents people who don’t have access to your CMS from accessing draft URLs.\n\n**Second**, if your headless CMS supports setting custom draft URLs, specify the following as the draft URL. This assumes that your Route Handler is located at `app/api/draft/route.ts`\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nhttps://<your-site>/api/draft?secret=<token>&slug=<path>\n```\n\n- `<your-site>` should be your deployment domain.\n- `<token>` should be replaced with the secret token you generated.\n- `<path>` should be the path for the page that you want to view. If you want to view `/posts/foo`, then you should use `&slug=/posts/foo`.\n\nYour headless CMS might allow you to include a variable in the draft URL so that `<path>` can be set dynamically based on the CMS’s data like so: `&slug=/posts/{entry.fields.slug}`\n\n**Finally**, in the Route Handler:\n\n- Check that the secret matches and that the `slug` parameter exists (if not, the request should fail).\n- Call `draftMode.enable()` to set the cookie.\n- Then redirect the browser to the path specified by `slug`.\n\n```ts filename=\"app/api/draft/route.ts\" switcher\n// route handler with secret and slug\nimport { draftMode } from 'next/headers'\nimport { redirect } from 'next/navigation'\n\nexport async function GET(request: Request) {\n  // Parse query string parameters\n  const { searchParams } = new URL(request.url)\n  const secret = searchParams.get('secret')\n  const slug = searchParams.get('slug')\n\n  // Check the secret and next parameters\n  // This secret should only be known to this route handler and the CMS\n  if (secret !== 'MY_SECRET_TOKEN' || !slug) {\n    return new Response('Invalid token', { status: 401 })\n  }\n\n  // Fetch the headless CMS to check if the provided `slug` exists\n  // getPostBySlug would implement the required fetching logic to the headless CMS\n  const post = await getPostBySlug(slug)\n\n  // If the slug doesn't exist prevent draft mode from being enabled\n  if (!post) {\n    return new Response('Invalid slug', { status: 401 })\n  }\n\n  // Enable Draft Mode by setting the cookie\n  draftMode().enable()\n\n  // Redirect to the path from the fetched post\n  // We don't redirect to searchParams.slug as that might lead to open redirect vulnerabilities\n  redirect(post.slug)\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"app/api/draft/route.js\" switcher\n// route handler with secret and slug\nimport { draftMode } from 'next/headers'\nimport { redirect } from 'next/navigation'\n\nexport async function GET(request) {\n  // Parse query string parameters\n  const { searchParams } = new URL(request.url)\n  const secret = searchParams.get('secret')\n  const slug = searchParams.get('slug')\n\n  // Check the secret and next parameters\n  // This secret should only be known to this route handler and the CMS\n  if (secret !== 'MY_SECRET_TOKEN' || !slug) {\n    return new Response('Invalid token', { status: 401 })\n  }\n\n  // Fetch the headless CMS to check if the provided `slug` exists\n  // getPostBySlug would implement the required fetching logic to the headless CMS\n  const post = await getPostBySlug(slug)\n\n  // If the slug doesn't exist prevent draft mode from being enabled\n  if (!post) {\n    return new Response('Invalid slug', { status: 401 })\n  }\n\n  // Enable Draft Mode by setting the cookie\n  draftMode().enable()\n\n  // Redirect to the path from the fetched post\n  // We don't redirect to searchParams.slug as that might lead to open redirect vulnerabilities\n  redirect(post.slug)\n}\n```\n\nIf it succeeds, then the browser will be redirected to the path you want to view with the draft mode cookie.\n\n## Step 2: Update page\n\nThe next step is to update your page to check the value of `draftMode().isEnabled`.\n\nIf you request a page which has the cookie set, then data will be fetched at **request time** (instead of at build time).\n\nFurthermore, the value of `isEnabled` will be `true`.\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/page.tsx\" switcher\n// page that fetches data\nimport { draftMode } from 'next/headers'\n\nasync function getData() {\n  const { isEnabled } = draftMode()\n\n  const url = isEnabled\n    ? 'https://draft.example.com'\n    : 'https://production.example.com'\n\n  const res = await fetch(url)\n\n  return res.json()\n}\n\nexport default async function Page() {\n  const { title, desc } = await getData()\n\n  return (\n    <main>\n      <h1>{title}</h1>\n      <p>{desc}</p>\n    </main>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/page.js\" switcher\n// page that fetches data\nimport { draftMode } from 'next/headers'\n\nasync function getData() {\n  const { isEnabled } = draftMode()\n\n  const url = isEnabled\n    ? 'https://draft.example.com'\n    : 'https://production.example.com'\n\n  const res = await fetch(url)\n\n  return res.json()\n}\n\nexport default async function Page() {\n  const { title, desc } = await getData()\n\n  return (\n    <main>\n      <h1>{title}</h1>\n      <p>{desc}</p>\n    </main>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nThat's it! If you access the draft Route Handler (with `secret` and `slug`) from your headless CMS or manually, you should now be able to see the draft content. And if you update your draft without publishing, you should be able to view the draft.\n\nSet this as the draft URL on your headless CMS or access manually, and you should be able to see the draft.\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nhttps://<your-site>/api/draft?secret=<token>&slug=<path>\n```\n\n## More Details\n\n### Clear the Draft Mode cookie\n\nBy default, the Draft Mode session ends when the browser is closed.\n\nTo clear the Draft Mode cookie manually, create a Route Handler that calls `draftMode().disable()`:\n\n```ts filename=\"app/api/disable-draft/route.ts\" switcher\nimport { draftMode } from 'next/headers'\n\nexport async function GET(request: Request) {\n  draftMode().disable()\n  return new Response('Draft mode is disabled')\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"app/api/disable-draft/route.js\" switcher\nimport { draftMode } from 'next/headers'\n\nexport async function GET(request) {\n  draftMode().disable()\n  return new Response('Draft mode is disabled')\n}\n```\n\nThen, send a request to `/api/disable-draft` to invoke the Route Handler. If calling this route using [`next/link`](/docs/app/api-reference/components/link), you must pass `prefetch={false}` to prevent accidentally deleting the cookie on prefetch.\n\n### Unique per `next build`\n\nA new bypass cookie value will be generated each time you run `next build`.\n\nThis ensures that the bypass cookie can’t be guessed.\n\n> **Good to know**: To test Draft Mode locally over HTTP, your browser will need to allow third-party cookies and local storage access.\n"},{"path":"docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/07-configuring/15-content-security-policy.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/07-configuring/15-content-security-policy.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/content-security-policy","sha":"49efab01e0df1065288d07587493d815172c735d","size":7205,"content":"---\ntitle: Content Security Policy\ndescription: Learn how to set a Content Security Policy (CSP) for your Next.js application.\nrelated:\n  links:\n    - app/building-your-application/routing/middleware\n    - app/api-reference/functions/headers\n---\n\n{/* The content of this doc is shared between the app and pages router. You can use the `<PagesOnly>Content</PagesOnly>` component to add content that is specific to the Pages Router. Any shared content should not be wrapped in a component. */}\n\n[Content Security Policy (CSP)](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) is important to guard your Next.js application against various security threats such as cross-site scripting (XSS), clickjacking, and other code injection attacks.\n\nBy using CSP, developers can specify which origins are permissible for content sources, scripts, stylesheets, images, fonts, objects, media (audio, video), iframes, and more.\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Examples</summary>\n\n- [Strict CSP](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-strict-csp)\n\n</details>\n\n## Nonces\n\nA [nonce](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/nonce) is a unique, random string of characters created for a one-time use. It is used in conjunction with CSP to selectively allow certain inline scripts or styles to execute, bypassing strict CSP directives.\n\n### Why use a nonce?\n\nEven though CSPs are designed to block malicious scripts, there are legitimate scenarios where inline scripts are necessary. In such cases, nonces offer a way to allow these scripts to execute if they have the correct nonce.\n\n### Adding a nonce with Middleware\n\n[Middleware](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware) enables you to add headers and generate nonces before the page renders.\n\nEvery time a page is viewed, a fresh nonce should be generated. This means that you **must use dynamic rendering to add nonces**.\n\nFor example:\n\n```ts filename=\"middleware.ts\" switcher\nimport { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n\nexport function middleware(request: NextRequest) {\n  const nonce = Buffer.from(crypto.randomUUID()).toString('base64')\n  const cspHeader = `\n    default-src 'self';\n    script-src 'self' 'nonce-${nonce}' 'strict-dynamic';\n    style-src 'self' 'nonce-${nonce}';\n    img-src 'self' blob: data:;\n    font-src 'self';\n    object-src 'none';\n    base-uri 'self';\n    form-action 'self';\n    frame-ancestors 'none';\n    upgrade-insecure-requests;\n`\n  // Replace newline characters and spaces\n  const contentSecurityPolicyHeaderValue = cspHeader\n    .replace(/\\s{2,}/g, ' ')\n    .trim()\n\n  const requestHeaders = new Headers(request.headers)\n  requestHeaders.set('x-nonce', nonce)\n\n  requestHeaders.set(\n    'Content-Security-Policy',\n    contentSecurityPolicyHeaderValue\n  )\n\n  const response = NextResponse.next({\n    request: {\n      headers: requestHeaders,\n    },\n  })\n  response.headers.set(\n    'Content-Security-Policy',\n    contentSecurityPolicyHeaderValue\n  )\n\n  return response\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"middleware.js\" switcher\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n\nexport function middleware(request) {\n  const nonce = Buffer.from(crypto.randomUUID()).toString('base64')\n  const cspHeader = `\n    default-src 'self';\n    script-src 'self' 'nonce-${nonce}' 'strict-dynamic';\n    style-src 'self' 'nonce-${nonce}';\n    img-src 'self' blob: data:;\n    font-src 'self';\n    object-src 'none';\n    base-uri 'self';\n    form-action 'self';\n    frame-ancestors 'none';\n    upgrade-insecure-requests;\n`\n  // Replace newline characters and spaces\n  const contentSecurityPolicyHeaderValue = cspHeader\n    .replace(/\\s{2,}/g, ' ')\n    .trim()\n\n  const requestHeaders = new Headers(request.headers)\n  requestHeaders.set('x-nonce', nonce)\n  requestHeaders.set(\n    'Content-Security-Policy',\n    contentSecurityPolicyHeaderValue\n  )\n\n  const response = NextResponse.next({\n    request: {\n      headers: requestHeaders,\n    },\n  })\n  response.headers.set(\n    'Content-Security-Policy',\n    contentSecurityPolicyHeaderValue\n  )\n\n  return response\n}\n```\n\nBy default, Middleware runs on all requests. You can filter Middleware to run on specific paths using a [`matcher`](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware#matcher).\n\nWe recommend ignoring matching prefetches (from `next/link`) and static assets that don't need the CSP header.\n\n```ts filename=\"middleware.ts\" switcher\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: [\n    /*\n     * Match all request paths except for the ones starting with:\n     * - api (API routes)\n     * - _next/static (static files)\n     * - _next/image (image optimization files)\n     * - favicon.ico (favicon file)\n     */\n    {\n      source: '/((?!api|_next/static|_next/image|favicon.ico).*)',\n      missing: [\n        { type: 'header', key: 'next-router-prefetch' },\n        { type: 'header', key: 'purpose', value: 'prefetch' },\n      ],\n    },\n  ],\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"middleware.js\" switcher\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: [\n    /*\n     * Match all request paths except for the ones starting with:\n     * - api (API routes)\n     * - _next/static (static files)\n     * - _next/image (image optimization files)\n     * - favicon.ico (favicon file)\n     */\n    {\n      source: '/((?!api|_next/static|_next/image|favicon.ico).*)',\n      missing: [\n        { type: 'header', key: 'next-router-prefetch' },\n        { type: 'header', key: 'purpose', value: 'prefetch' },\n      ],\n    },\n  ],\n}\n```\n\n### Reading the nonce\n\nYou can now read the nonce from a [Server Component](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components) using [`headers`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/headers):\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/page.tsx\" switcher\nimport { headers } from 'next/headers'\nimport Script from 'next/script'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  const nonce = headers().get('x-nonce')\n\n  return (\n    <Script\n      src=\"https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js\"\n      strategy=\"afterInteractive\"\n      nonce={nonce}\n    />\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/page.jsx\" switcher\nimport { headers } from 'next/headers'\nimport Script from 'next/script'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  const nonce = headers().get('x-nonce')\n\n  return (\n    <Script\n      src=\"https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js\"\n      strategy=\"afterInteractive\"\n      nonce={nonce}\n    />\n  )\n}\n```\n\n## Without Nonces\n\nFor applications that do not require nonces, you can set the CSP header directly in your [`next.config.js`](/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js) file:\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nconst cspHeader = `\n    default-src 'self';\n    script-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval' 'unsafe-inline';\n    style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';\n    img-src 'self' blob: data:;\n    font-src 'self';\n    object-src 'none';\n    base-uri 'self';\n    form-action 'self';\n    frame-ancestors 'none';\n    upgrade-insecure-requests;\n`\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  async headers() {\n    return [\n      {\n        source: '/(.*)',\n        headers: [\n          {\n            key: 'Content-Security-Policy',\n            value: cspHeader.replace(/\\n/g, ''),\n          },\n        ],\n      },\n    ]\n  },\n}\n```\n\n## Version History\n\nWe recommend using `v13.4.20+` of Next.js to properly handle and apply nonces.\n"},{"path":"docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/08-testing/04-cypress.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/08-testing/04-cypress.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/testing/cypress","sha":"c8a515ded87d019809ae1b07ca9e7e898e27b5d8","size":8500,"content":"---\ntitle: Setting up Cypress with Next.js\nnav_title: Cypress\ndescription: Learn how to set up Cypress with Next.js for End-to-End (E2E) and Component Testing.\n---\n\n[Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) is a test runner used for **End-to-End (E2E)** and **Component Testing**. This page will show you how to set up Cypress with Next.js and write your first tests.\n\n> **Warning:**\n>\n> - For **component testing**, Cypress currently does not support [Next.js version 14](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/28185) and `async` Server Components. These issues are being tracked. For now, component testing works with Next.js version 13, and we recommend E2E testing for `async` Server Components.\n> - Cypress versions below 13.6.3 do not support [TypeScript version 5](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/27731) with `moduleResolution:\"bundler\"`. However, this issue has been resolved in Cypress version 13.6.3 and later. [cypress v13.6.3](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/changelog#13-6-3)\n\n<AppOnly>\n\n## Quickstart\n\nYou can use `create-next-app` with the [with-cypress example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-cypress) to quickly get started.\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nnpx create-next-app@latest --example with-cypress with-cypress-app\n```\n\n</AppOnly>\n\n## Manual setup\n\nTo manually set up Cypress, install `cypress` as a dev dependency:\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nnpm install -D cypress\n# or\nyarn add -D cypress\n# or\npnpm install -D cypress\n```\n\nAdd the Cypress `open` command to the `package.json` scripts field:\n\n```json filename=\"package.json\"\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"dev\": \"next dev\",\n    \"build\": \"next build\",\n    \"start\": \"next start\",\n    \"lint\": \"next lint\",\n    \"cypress:open\": \"cypress open\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nRun Cypress for the first time to open the Cypress testing suite:\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nnpm run cypress:open\n```\n\nYou can choose to configure **E2E Testing** and/or **Component Testing**. Selecting any of these options will automatically create a `cypress.config.js` file and a `cypress` folder in your project.\n\n## Creating your first Cypress E2E test\n\nEnsure your `cypress.config.js` file has the following configuration:\n\n```ts filename=\"cypress.config.ts\"\nimport { defineConfig } from 'cypress'\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  e2e: {\n    setupNodeEvents(on, config) {},\n  },\n})\n```\n\n```js filename=\"cypress.config.js\"\nconst { defineConfig } = require('cypress')\n\nmodule.exports = defineConfig({\n  e2e: {\n    setupNodeEvents(on, config) {},\n  },\n})\n```\n\nThen, create two new Next.js files:\n\n<AppOnly>\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/page.js\"\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Home</h1>\n      <Link href=\"/about\">About</Link>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/about/page.js\"\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>About</h1>\n      <Link href=\"/\">Home</Link>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n</AppOnly>\n\n<PagesOnly>\n\n```jsx filename=\"pages/index.js\"\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n\nexport default function Home() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Home</h1>\n      <Link href=\"/about\">About</Link>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"pages/about.js\"\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n\nexport default function About() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>About</h1>\n      <Link href=\"/\">Home</Link>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n</PagesOnly>\n\nAdd a test to check your navigation is working correctly:\n\n```js filename=\"cypress/e2e/app.cy.js\"\ndescribe('Navigation', () => {\n  it('should navigate to the about page', () => {\n    // Start from the index page\n    cy.visit('http://localhost:3000/')\n\n    // Find a link with an href attribute containing \"about\" and click it\n    cy.get('a[href*=\"about\"]').click()\n\n    // The new url should include \"/about\"\n    cy.url().should('include', '/about')\n\n    // The new page should contain an h1 with \"About\"\n    cy.get('h1').contains('About')\n  })\n})\n```\n\n### Running E2E Tests\n\nCypress will simulate a user navigating your application, this requires your Next.js server to be running. We recommend running your tests against your production code to more closely resemble how your application will behave.\n\nRun `npm run build && npm run start` to build your Next.js application, then run `npm run cypress:open` in another terminal window to start Cypress and run your E2E testing suite.\n\n> **Good to know:**\n>\n> - You can use `cy.visit(\"/\")` instead of `cy.visit(\"http://localhost:3000/\")` by adding `baseUrl: 'http://localhost:3000'` to the `cypress.config.js` configuration file.\n> - Alternatively, you can install the `start-server-and-test` package to run the Next.js production server in conjunction with Cypress. After installation, add `\"test\": \"start-server-and-test start http://localhost:3000 cypress\"` to your `package.json` scripts field. Remember to rebuild your application after new changes.\n\n## Creating your first Cypress component test\n\nComponent tests build and mount a specific component without having to bundle your whole application or start a server.\n\nSelect **Component Testing** in the Cypress app, then select **Next.js** as your front-end framework. A `cypress/component` folder will be created in your project, and a `cypress.config.js` file will be updated to enable component testing.\n\nEnsure your `cypress.config.js` file has the following configuration:\n\n```ts filename=\"cypress.config.ts\"\nimport { defineConfig } from 'cypress'\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  component: {\n    devServer: {\n      framework: 'next',\n      bundler: 'webpack',\n    },\n  },\n})\n```\n\n```js filename=\"cypress.config.js\"\nconst { defineConfig } = require('cypress')\n\nmodule.exports = defineConfig({\n  component: {\n    devServer: {\n      framework: 'next',\n      bundler: 'webpack',\n    },\n  },\n})\n```\n\nAssuming the same components from the previous section, add a test to validate a component is rendering the expected output:\n\n<AppOnly>\n\n```tsx filename=\"cypress/component/about.cy.tsx\"\nimport Page from '../../app/page'\n\ndescribe('<Page />', () => {\n  it('should render and display expected content', () => {\n    // Mount the React component for the Home page\n    cy.mount(<Page />)\n\n    // The new page should contain an h1 with \"Home\"\n    cy.get('h1').contains('Home')\n\n    // Validate that a link with the expected URL is present\n    // Following the link is better suited to an E2E test\n    cy.get('a[href=\"/about\"]').should('be.visible')\n  })\n})\n```\n\n</AppOnly>\n\n<PagesOnly>\n\n```jsx filename=\"cypress/component/about.cy.js\"\nimport AboutPage from '../../pages/about'\n\ndescribe('<AboutPage />', () => {\n  it('should render and display expected content', () => {\n    // Mount the React component for the About page\n    cy.mount(<AboutPage />)\n\n    // The new page should contain an h1 with \"About page\"\n    cy.get('h1').contains('About')\n\n    // Validate that a link with the expected URL is present\n    // *Following* the link is better suited to an E2E test\n    cy.get('a[href=\"/\"]').should('be.visible')\n  })\n})\n```\n\n</PagesOnly>\n\n> **Good to know**:\n>\n> - Cypress currently doesn't support component testing for `async` Server Components. We recommend using E2E testing.\n> - Since component tests do not require a Next.js server, features like `<Image />` that rely on a server being available may not function out-of-the-box.\n\n### Running Component Tests\n\nRun `npm run cypress:open` in your terminal to start Cypress and run your component testing suite.\n\n## Continuous Integration (CI)\n\nIn addition to interactive testing, you can also run Cypress headlessly using the `cypress run` command, which is better suited for CI environments:\n\n```json filename=\"package.json\"\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    //...\n    \"e2e\": \"start-server-and-test dev http://localhost:3000 \\\"cypress open --e2e\\\"\",\n    \"e2e:headless\": \"start-server-and-test dev http://localhost:3000 \\\"cypress run --e2e\\\"\",\n    \"component\": \"cypress open --component\",\n    \"component:headless\": \"cypress run --component\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nYou can learn more about Cypress and Continuous Integration from these resources:\n\n- [Next.js with Cypress example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-cypress)\n- [Cypress Continuous Integration Docs](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/continuous-integration/introduction)\n- [Cypress GitHub Actions Guide](https://on.cypress.io/github-actions)\n- [Official Cypress GitHub Action](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action)\n- [Cypress Discord](https://discord.com/invite/cypress)\n"},{"path":"docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/08-testing/02-jest.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/08-testing/02-jest.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/testing/jest","sha":"6ed2fb3398eab4f37ff54d3f2297b47f17566090","size":12686,"content":"---\ntitle: Setting up Jest with Next.js\nnav_title: Jest\ndescription: Learn how to set up Jest with Next.js for Unit Testing and Snapshot Testing.\n---\n\nJest and React Testing Library are frequently used together for **Unit Testing** and **Snapshot Testing**. This guide will show you how to set up Jest with Next.js and write your first tests.\n\n> **Good to know:** Since `async` Server Components are new to the React ecosystem, Jest currently does not support them. While you can still run **unit tests** for synchronous Server and Client Components, we recommend using an **E2E tests** for `async` components.\n\n## Quickstart\n\nYou can use `create-next-app` with the Next.js [with-jest](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-jest) example to quickly get started:\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nnpx create-next-app@latest --example with-jest with-jest-app\n```\n\n## Manual setup\n\nSince the release of [Next.js 12](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-12), Next.js now has built-in configuration for Jest.\n\nTo set up Jest, install `jest` and the following packages as dev dependencies:\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nnpm install -D jest jest-environment-jsdom @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom\n# or\nyarn add -D jest jest-environment-jsdom @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom\n# or\npnpm install -D jest jest-environment-jsdom @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom\n```\n\nGenerate a basic Jest configuration file by running the following command:\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nnpm init jest@latest\n# or\nyarn create jest@latest\n# or\npnpm create jest@latest\n```\n\nThis will take you through a series of prompts to setup Jest for your project, including automatically creating a `jest.config.ts|js` file.\n\nUpdate your config file to use `next/jest`. This transformer has all the necessary configuration options for Jest to work with Next.js:\n\n```ts filename=\"jest.config.ts\" switcher\nimport type { Config } from 'jest'\nimport nextJest from 'next/jest.js'\n\nconst createJestConfig = nextJest({\n  // Provide the path to your Next.js app to load next.config.js and .env files in your test environment\n  dir: './',\n})\n\n// Add any custom config to be passed to Jest\nconst config: Config = {\n  coverageProvider: 'v8',\n  testEnvironment: 'jsdom',\n  // Add more setup options before each test is run\n  // setupFilesAfterEnv: ['<rootDir>/jest.setup.ts'],\n}\n\n// createJestConfig is exported this way to ensure that next/jest can load the Next.js config which is async\nexport default createJestConfig(config)\n```\n\n```js filename=\"jest.config.js\" switcher\nconst nextJest = require('next/jest')\n\n/** @type {import('jest').Config} */\nconst createJestConfig = nextJest({\n  // Provide the path to your Next.js app to load next.config.js and .env files in your test environment\n  dir: './',\n})\n\n// Add any custom config to be passed to Jest\nconst config = {\n  coverageProvider: 'v8',\n  testEnvironment: 'jsdom',\n  // Add more setup options before each test is run\n  // setupFilesAfterEnv: ['<rootDir>/jest.setup.ts'],\n}\n\n// createJestConfig is exported this way to ensure that next/jest can load the Next.js config which is async\nmodule.exports = createJestConfig(config)\n```\n\nUnder the hood, `next/jest` is automatically configuring Jest for you, including:\n\n- Setting up `transform` using the [Next.js Compiler](/docs/architecture/nextjs-compiler)\n- Auto mocking stylesheets (`.css`, `.module.css`, and their scss variants), image imports and [`next/font`](/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts)\n- Loading `.env` (and all variants) into `process.env`\n- Ignoring `node_modules` from test resolving and transforms\n- Ignoring `.next` from test resolving\n- Loading `next.config.js` for flags that enable SWC transforms\n\n> **Good to know**: To test environment variables directly, load them manually in a separate setup script or in your `jest.config.ts` file. For more information, please see [Test Environment Variables](/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/environment-variables#test-environment-variables).\n\n<PagesOnly>\n\n## Setting up Jest (with Babel)\n\nIf you opt out of the [Next.js Compiler](/docs/architecture/nextjs-compiler) and use Babel instead, you will need to manually configure Jest and install `babel-jest` and `identity-obj-proxy` in addition to the packages above.\n\nHere are the recommended options to configure Jest for Next.js:\n\n```js filename=\"jest.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  collectCoverage: true,\n  // on node 14.x coverage provider v8 offers good speed and more or less good report\n  coverageProvider: 'v8',\n  collectCoverageFrom: [\n    '**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}',\n    '!**/*.d.ts',\n    '!**/node_modules/**',\n    '!<rootDir>/out/**',\n    '!<rootDir>/.next/**',\n    '!<rootDir>/*.config.js',\n    '!<rootDir>/coverage/**',\n  ],\n  moduleNameMapper: {\n    // Handle CSS imports (with CSS modules)\n    // https://jestjs.io/docs/webpack#mocking-css-modules\n    '^.+\\\\.module\\\\.(css|sass|scss)$': 'identity-obj-proxy',\n\n    // Handle CSS imports (without CSS modules)\n    '^.+\\\\.(css|sass|scss)$': '<rootDir>/__mocks__/styleMock.js',\n\n    // Handle image imports\n    // https://jestjs.io/docs/webpack#handling-static-assets\n    '^.+\\\\.(png|jpg|jpeg|gif|webp|avif|ico|bmp|svg)$/i': `<rootDir>/__mocks__/fileMock.js`,\n\n    // Handle module aliases\n    '^@/components/(.*)$': '<rootDir>/components/$1',\n\n    // Handle @next/font\n    '@next/font/(.*)': `<rootDir>/__mocks__/nextFontMock.js`,\n    // Handle next/font\n    'next/font/(.*)': `<rootDir>/__mocks__/nextFontMock.js`,\n    // Disable server-only\n    'server-only': `<rootDir>/__mocks__/empty.js`,\n  },\n  // Add more setup options before each test is run\n  // setupFilesAfterEnv: ['<rootDir>/jest.setup.js'],\n  testPathIgnorePatterns: ['<rootDir>/node_modules/', '<rootDir>/.next/'],\n  testEnvironment: 'jsdom',\n  transform: {\n    // Use babel-jest to transpile tests with the next/babel preset\n    // https://jestjs.io/docs/configuration#transform-objectstring-pathtotransformer--pathtotransformer-object\n    '^.+\\\\.(js|jsx|ts|tsx)$': ['babel-jest', { presets: ['next/babel'] }],\n  },\n  transformIgnorePatterns: [\n    '/node_modules/',\n    '^.+\\\\.module\\\\.(css|sass|scss)$',\n  ],\n}\n```\n\nYou can learn more about each configuration option in the [Jest docs](https://jestjs.io/docs/configuration). We also recommend reviewing [`next/jest` configuration](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/e02fe314dcd0ae614c65b505c6daafbdeebb920e/packages/next/src/build/jest/jest.ts) to see how Next.js configures Jest.\n\n### Handling stylesheets and image imports\n\nStylesheets and images aren't used in the tests but importing them may cause errors, so they will need to be mocked.\n\nCreate the mock files referenced in the configuration above - `fileMock.js` and `styleMock.js` - inside a `__mocks__` directory:\n\n```js filename=\"__mocks__/fileMock.js\"\nmodule.exports = 'test-file-stub'\n```\n\n```js filename=\"__mocks__/styleMock.js\"\nmodule.exports = {}\n```\n\nFor more information on handling static assets, please refer to the [Jest Docs](https://jestjs.io/docs/webpack#handling-static-assets).\n\n## Handling Fonts\n\nTo handle fonts, create the `nextFontMock.js` file inside the `__mocks__` directory, and add the following configuration:\n\n```js filename=\"__mocks__/nextFontMock.js\"\nmodule.exports = new Proxy(\n  {},\n  {\n    get: function getter() {\n      return () => ({\n        className: 'className',\n        variable: 'variable',\n        style: { fontFamily: 'fontFamily' },\n      })\n    },\n  }\n)\n```\n\n</PagesOnly>\n\n## Optional: Handling Absolute Imports and Module Path Aliases\n\nIf your project is using [Module Path Aliases](/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/absolute-imports-and-module-aliases), you will need to configure Jest to resolve the imports by matching the paths option in the `jsconfig.json` file with the `moduleNameMapper` option in the `jest.config.js` file. For example:\n\n```json filename=\"tsconfig.json or jsconfig.json\"\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"module\": \"esnext\",\n    \"moduleResolution\": \"bundler\",\n    \"baseUrl\": \"./\",\n    \"paths\": {\n      \"@/components/*\": [\"components/*\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"jest.config.js\"\nmoduleNameMapper: {\n  // ...\n  '^@/components/(.*)$': '<rootDir>/components/$1',\n}\n```\n\n## Optional: Extend Jest with custom matchers\n\n`@testing-library/jest-dom` includes a set of convenient [custom matchers](https://github.com/testing-library/jest-dom#custom-matchers) such as `.toBeInTheDocument()` making it easier to write tests. You can import the custom matchers for every test by adding the following option to the Jest configuration file:\n\n```ts filename=\"jest.config.ts\" switcher\nsetupFilesAfterEnv: ['<rootDir>/jest.setup.ts']\n```\n\n```js filename=\"jest.config.js\" switcher\nsetupFilesAfterEnv: ['<rootDir>/jest.setup.js']\n```\n\nThen, inside `jest.setup.ts`, add the following import:\n\n```ts filename=\"jest.setup.ts\" switcher\nimport '@testing-library/jest-dom'\n```\n\n```js filename=\"jest.setup.js\" switcher\nimport '@testing-library/jest-dom'\n```\n\n> **Good to know:**[`extend-expect` was removed in `v6.0`](https://github.com/testing-library/jest-dom/releases/tag/v6.0.0), so if you are using `@testing-library/jest-dom` before version 6, you will need to import `@testing-library/jest-dom/extend-expect` instead.\n\nIf you need to add more setup options before each test, you can add them to the `jest.setup.js` file above.\n\n## Add a test script to `package.json`:\n\nFinally, add a Jest `test` script to your `package.json` file:\n\n```json filename=\"package.json\" highlight={6-7}\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"dev\": \"next dev\",\n    \"build\": \"next build\",\n    \"start\": \"next start\",\n    \"test\": \"jest\",\n    \"test:watch\": \"jest --watch\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n`jest --watch` will re-run tests when a file is changed. For more Jest CLI options, please refer to the [Jest Docs](https://jestjs.io/docs/cli#reference).\n\n### Creating your first test:\n\nYour project is now ready to run tests. Create a folder called `__tests__` in your project's root directory.\n\n<PagesOnly>\n\nFor example, we can add a test to check if the `<Home />` component successfully renders a heading:\n\n```jsx filename=\"pages/index.js\nexport default function Home() {\n  return <h1>Home</h1>\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"__tests__/index.test.js\"\nimport '@testing-library/jest-dom'\nimport { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react'\nimport Home from '../pages/index'\n\ndescribe('Home', () => {\n  it('renders a heading', () => {\n    render(<Home />)\n\n    const heading = screen.getByRole('heading', { level: 1 })\n\n    expect(heading).toBeInTheDocument()\n  })\n})\n```\n\n</PagesOnly>\n\n<AppOnly>\n\nFor example, we can add a test to check if the `<Page />` component successfully renders a heading:\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/page.js\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n\nexport default function Home() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Home</h1>\n      <Link href=\"/about\">About</Link>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"__tests__/page.test.jsx\"\nimport '@testing-library/jest-dom'\nimport { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react'\nimport Page from '../app/page'\n\ndescribe('Page', () => {\n  it('renders a heading', () => {\n    render(<Page />)\n\n    const heading = screen.getByRole('heading', { level: 1 })\n\n    expect(heading).toBeInTheDocument()\n  })\n})\n```\n\n</AppOnly>\n\nOptionally, add a [snapshot test](https://jestjs.io/docs/snapshot-testing) to keep track of any unexpected changes in your component:\n\n<PagesOnly>\n\n```jsx filename=\"__tests__/snapshot.js\"\nimport { render } from '@testing-library/react'\nimport Home from '../pages/index'\n\nit('renders homepage unchanged', () => {\n  const { container } = render(<Home />)\n  expect(container).toMatchSnapshot()\n})\n```\n\n> **Good to know**: Test files should not be included inside the Pages Router because any files inside the Pages Router are considered routes.\n\n</PagesOnly>\n\n<AppOnly>\n\n```jsx filename=\"__tests__/snapshot.js\"\nimport { render } from '@testing-library/react'\nimport Page from '../app/page'\n\nit('renders homepage unchanged', () => {\n  const { container } = render(<Page />)\n  expect(container).toMatchSnapshot()\n})\n```\n\n</AppOnly>\n\n## Running your tests\n\nThen, run the following command to run your tests:\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nnpm run test\n# or\nyarn test\n# or\npnpm test\n```\n\n## Additional Resources\n\nFor further reading, you may find these resources helpful:\n\n- [Next.js with Jest example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-jest)\n- [Jest Docs](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started)\n- [React Testing Library Docs](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)\n- [Testing Playground](https://testing-playground.com/) - use good testing practices to match elements.\n"},{"path":"docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/08-testing/index.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/08-testing/index.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/testing","sha":"fb1aaa60024ddbb775122e57106444d4be764e68","size":1808,"content":"---\ntitle: Testing\ndescription: Learn how to set up Next.js with four commonly used testing tools — Cypress, Playwright, Vitest, and Jest.\n---\n\nIn React and Next.js, there are a few different types of tests you can write, each with its own purpose and use cases. This page provides an overview of types and commonly used tools you can use to test your application.\n\n## Types of tests\n\n- **Unit testing** involves testing individual units (or blocks of code) in isolation. In React, a unit can be a single function, hook, or component.\n  - **Component testing** is a more focused version of unit testing where the primary subject of the tests is React components. This may involve testing how components are rendered, their interaction with props, and their behavior in response to user events.\n  - **Integration testing** involves testing how multiple units work together. This can be a combination of components, hooks, and functions.\n- **End-to-End (E2E) Testing** involves testing user flows in an environment that simulates real user scenarios, like the browser. This means testing specific tasks (e.g. signup flow) in a production-like environment.\n- **Snapshot testing** involves capturing the rendered output of a component and saving it to a snapshot file. When tests run, the current rendered output of the component is compared against the saved snapshot. Changes in the snapshot are used to indicate unexpected changes in behavior.\n\n<AppOnly>\n\n## Async Server Components\n\nSince `async` Server Components are new to the React ecosystem, some tools do not fully support them. In the meantime, we recommend using **End-to-End Testing** over **Unit Testing** for `async` components.\n\n</AppOnly>\n\n## Guides\n\nSee the guides below to learn how to set up Next.js with these commonly used testing tools:\n"},{"path":"docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/08-testing/03-playwright.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/08-testing/03-playwright.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/testing/playwright","sha":"053408c06235adb9617603c5c95509fe167e9e3a","size":4399,"content":"---\ntitle: Setting up Playwright with Next.js\nnav_title: Playwright\ndescription: Learn how to set up Playwright with Next.js for End-to-End (E2E) testing.\n---\n\nPlaywright is a testing framework that lets you automate Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit with a single API. You can use it to write **End-to-End (E2E)** testing. This guide will show you how to set up Playwright with Next.js and write your first tests.\n\n## Quickstart\n\nThe fastest way to get started is to use `create-next-app` with the [with-playwright example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-playwright). This will create a Next.js project complete with Playwright configured.\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nnpx create-next-app@latest --example with-playwright with-playwright-app\n```\n\n## Manual setup\n\nTo install Playwright, run the following command:\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nnpm init playwright\n# or\nyarn create playwright\n# or\npnpm create playwright\n```\n\nThis will take you through a series of prompts to setup and configure Playwright for your project, including adding a `playwright.config.ts` file. Please refer to the [Playwright installation guide](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro#installation) for the step-by-step guide.\n\n## Creating your first Playwright E2E test\n\nCreate two new Next.js pages:\n\n<AppOnly>\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/page.tsx\"\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Home</h1>\n      <Link href=\"/about\">About</Link>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/about/page.tsx\"\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>About</h1>\n      <Link href=\"/\">Home</Link>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n</AppOnly>\n\n<PagesOnly>\n\n```tsx filename=\"pages/index.ts\"\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n\nexport default function Home() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Home</h1>\n      <Link href=\"/about\">About</Link>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```tsx filename=\"pages/about.ts\"\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n\nexport default function About() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>About</h1>\n      <Link href=\"/\">Home</Link>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n</PagesOnly>\n\nThen, add a test to verify that your navigation is working correctly:\n\n```ts filename=\"tests/example.spec.ts\"\nimport { test, expect } from '@playwright/test'\n\ntest('should navigate to the about page', async ({ page }) => {\n  // Start from the index page (the baseURL is set via the webServer in the playwright.config.ts)\n  await page.goto('http://localhost:3000/')\n  // Find an element with the text 'About' and click on it\n  await page.click('text=About')\n  // The new URL should be \"/about\" (baseURL is used there)\n  await expect(page).toHaveURL('http://localhost:3000/about')\n  // The new page should contain an h1 with \"About\"\n  await expect(page.locator('h1')).toContainText('About')\n})\n```\n\n> **Good to know**:\n>\n> You can use `page.goto(\"/\")` instead of `page.goto(\"http://localhost:3000/\")`, if you add [`\"baseURL\": \"http://localhost:3000\"`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testoptions#test-options-base-url) to the `playwright.config.ts` [configuration file](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-configuration).\n\n### Running your Playwright tests\n\nPlaywright will simulate a user navigating your application using three browsers: Chromium, Firefox and Webkit, this requires your Next.js server to be running. We recommend running your tests against your production code to more closely resemble how your application will behave.\n\nRun `npm run build` and `npm run start`, then run `npx playwright test` in another terminal window to run the Playwright tests.\n\n> **Good to know**: Alternatively, you can use the [`webServer`](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-webserver/) feature to let Playwright start the development server and wait until it's fully available.\n\n### Running Playwright on Continuous Integration (CI)\n\nPlaywright will by default run your tests in the [headless mode](https://playwright.dev/docs/ci#running-headed). To install all the Playwright dependencies, run `npx playwright install-deps`.\n\nYou can learn more about Playwright and Continuous Integration from these resources:\n\n- [Next.js with Playwright example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-playwright)\n- [Playwright on your CI provider](https://playwright.dev/docs/ci)\n- [Playwright Discord](https://discord.com/invite/playwright-807756831384403968)\n"},{"path":"docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/08-testing/01-vitest.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/08-testing/01-vitest.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/testing/vitest","sha":"bad760b1a3a9de40617a3339c959123e3e02b794","size":5160,"content":"---\ntitle: Setting up Vitest with Next.js\nnav_title: Vitest\ndescription: Learn how to set up Vitest with Next.js for Unit Testing.\n---\n\nVite and React Testing Library are frequently used together for **Unit Testing**.

[react()],\n  test: {\n    environment: 'jsdom',\n  },\n})\n```\n\n```js filename=\"vitest.config.js\" switcher\nimport { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config'\nimport react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  plugins: [react()],\n  test: {\n    environment: 'jsdom',\n  },\n})\n```\n\nFor more information on configuring Vitest, please refer to the [Vitest Configuration](https://vitest.dev/config/#configuration) docs.\n\nThen, add a `test` script to your `package.json`:\n\n```json filename=\"package.json\"\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"dev\": \"next dev\",\n    \"build\": \"next build\",\n    \"start\": \"next start\",\n    \"test\": \"vitest\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWhen you run `npm run test`, Vitest will **watch** for changes in your project by default.\n\n## Creating your first Vitest Unit Test\n\nCheck that everything is working by creating a test to check if the `<Page />` component successfully renders a heading:\n\n<AppOnly>\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/page.tsx\" switcher\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Home</h1>\n      <Link href=\"/about\">About</Link>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/page.jsx\" switcher\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Home</h1>\n      <Link href=\"/about\">About</Link>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```tsx filename=\"__tests__/page.test.tsx\" switcher\nimport { expect, test } from 'vitest'\nimport { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react'\nimport Page from '../app/page'\n\ntest('Page', () => {\n  render(<Page />)\n  expect(screen.getByRole('heading', { level: 1, name: 'Home' })).toBeDefined()\n})\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"__tests__/page.test.jsx\" switcher\nimport { expect, test } from 'vitest'\nimport { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react'\nimport Page from '../app/page'\n\ntest('Page', () => {\n  render(<Page />)\n  expect(screen.getByRole('heading', { level: 1, name: 'Home' })).toBeDefined()\n})\n```\n\n> **Good to know**: The example above uses the common `__tests__` convention, but test files can also be colocated inside the `app` router.\n\n</AppOnly>\n\n<PagesOnly>\n\n```tsx filename=\"pages/index.tsx\" switcher\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Home</h1>\n      <Link href=\"/about\">About</Link>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"pages/index.jsx\" switcher\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Home</h1>\n      <Link href=\"/about\">About</Link>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```tsx filename=\"__tests__/index.test.tsx\" switcher\nimport { expect, test } from 'vitest'\nimport { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react'\nimport Page from '../pages/index'\n\ntest('Page', () => {\n  render(<Page />)\n  expect(screen.getByRole('heading', { level: 1, name: 'Home' })).toBeDefined()\n})\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"__tests__/index.test.jsx\" switcher\nimport { expect, test } from

'Home' })).toBeDefined()\n})\n```\n\n</PagesOnly>\n\n## Running your tests\n\nThen, run the following command to run your tests:\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nnpm run test\n# or\nyarn test\n# or\npnpm test\n# or\nbun test\n```\n\n## Additional Resources\n\nYou may find these resources helpful:\n\n- [Next.js with Vitest

Production Checklist\ndescription: Recommendations to ensure the best performance and user experience before taking your Next.js application to production.\n---\n\nBefore taking your Next.js application to production, there are some optimizations and patterns you should consider implementing for the best user experience, performance, and security.\n\nThis page provides best practices that you can use as a reference when [building your application](#during-development), [before going to production](#before-going-to-production), and [after deployment](#after-deployment) - as well as the [automatic Next.js optimizations](#automatic-optimizations) you should be aware of.\n\n## Automatic optimizations\n\nThese Next.js optimizations are enabled by default and require no configuration:\n\n<AppOnly>\n\n- **[Server Components](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components):** Next.js uses Server Components by default. Server Components run on the server, and don't require JavaScript to render on the client. As such, they have no impact on the size of your client-side JavaScript bundles. You can then use [Client Components](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/client-components) as needed for interactivity.\n- **[Code-splitting](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/linking-and-navigating#how-routing-and-navigation-works):** Server Components enable automatic code-splitting by route segments. You may also consider [lazy loading](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/lazy-loading) Client Components and third-party libraries, where appropriate.\n- **[Prefetching](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/linking-and-navigating#2-prefetching):** When a link to a new route enters the user's viewport, Next.js prefetches the route in background. This makes navigation to new routes almost instant. You can opt out of prefetching, where appropriate.\n- **[Static Rendering](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components#static-rendering-default):** Next.js statically renders Server and Client Components on the server at build time and caches the rendered result to improve your application's performance. You can opt into [Dynamic Rendering](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components#dynamic-rendering) for specific routes, where appropriate. {/* TODO: Update when PPR is stable */}\n- **[Caching](/docs/app/building-your-application/caching):** Next.js caches data requests, the rendered result of Server and Client Components, static assets, and more, to reduce the number of network requests to your server, database, and backend services. You may opt out of caching, where appropriate.\n\n</AppOnly>\n\n<PagesOnly>\n\n- **[Code-splitting](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts):** Next.js automatically code-splits your application code by pages. This means only the code needed for the current page is loaded on navigation. You may also consider [lazy loading](/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/lazy-loading) third-party libraries, where appropriate.\n- **[Prefetching](/docs/pages/api-reference/components/link#prefetch):** When a link to a new route enters the user's viewport, Next.js prefetches the route in background. This makes navigation to new routes almost instant. You can opt out of prefetching, where appropriate.\n- **[Automatic Static Optimization](/docs/pages/building-your-application/rendering/automatic-static-optimization):** Next.js automatically determines that a page is static (can be pre-rendered) if it has no blocking data requirements. Optimized pages can be cached, and served to the end-user from multiple CDN locations. You may opt into [Server-side Rendering](/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-server-side-props), where appropriate.\n\n</PagesOnly>\n\nThese defaults aim to improve your application's performance, and reduce the cost and amount of data transferred on each network request.\n\n## During development\n\nWhile building your application, we recommend using the following features to ensure the best performance and user experience:\n\n### Routing and rendering\n\n<AppOnly>\n\n- **[Layouts](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/layouts-and-templates#layouts):** Use layouts to share UI across pages and enable [partial rendering](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/linking-and-navigating#4-partial-rendering) on navigation.\n- **[`<Link>` component](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/linking-and-navigating#link-component):** Use the `<Link>` component for [client-side navigation and prefetching](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/linking-and-navigating#how-routing-and-navigation-works).\n- **[Error Handling](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/error-handling):** Gracefully handle [catch-all errors](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/error-handling) and [404 errors](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/not-found) in production by creating custom error pages.\n- **[Composition Patterns](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/composition-patterns):** Follow the recommended composition patterns for Server and Client Components, and check the placement of your [`\"use client\"` boundaries](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/composition-patterns#moving-client-components-down-the-tree) to avoid unnecessarily increasing your client-side JavaScript bundle.\n- **[Dynamic Functions](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components#dynamic-functions):** Be aware that dynamic functions like [`cookies()`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/cookies) and the [`searchParams`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/page#searchparams-optional) prop will opt the entire route into [Dynamic Rendering](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components#dynamic-rendering) (or your whole application if used in the [Root Layout](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/layouts-and-templates#root-layout-required)). Ensure dynamic function usage is intentional and wrap them in `<Suspense>` boundaries where appropriate.\n\n> **Good to know**: [Partial Prerendering (Experimental)](/blog/next-14#partial-prerendering-preview) will allow parts of a route to be dynamic without opting the whole route into dynamic rendering.\n\n</AppOnly>\n\n<PagesOnly>\n\n- **[`<Link>` component](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/linking-and-navigating):** Use the `<Link>` component for client-side navigation and prefetching.\n- **[Custom Errors](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/custom-error):** Gracefully handle [500](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/custom-error#500-page) and [404 errors](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/custom-error#404-page)\n\n</PagesOnly>\n\n### Data fetching and caching\n\n<AppOnly>\n\n- **[Server Components](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/fetching#should-i-fetch-data-on-the-server-or-the-client):** Leverage the benefits of fetching data on the server using Server Components.\n- **[Route Handlers](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-handlers):** Use Route Handlers to access your backend resources from Client Components.

Also, consider [preloading data](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/fetching#preloading-data) where appropriate.\n- **[Data Caching](/docs/app/building-your-application/caching#data-cache):** Verify whether your data requests are being cached or not, and opt into caching, where appropriate. Ensure requests that don't use `fetch` are [cached](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/unstable_cache).\n- **[Static Images](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/static-assets):** Use the `public` directory to automatically cache your application's static assets, e.g. images.\n\n</AppOnly>\n\n<PagesOnly>\n\n- **[API Routes](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes):** Use Route Handlers to access your backend resources, and prevent sensitive secrets from being exposed to the client.\n- **[Data Caching](/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-static-props):** Verify whether your data requests are being cached or not, and opt into caching, where appropriate. Ensure requests that don't use `getStaticProps` are cached where appropriate.\n- **[Incremental Static Regeneration](/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/incremental-static-regeneration):** Use Incremental Static Regeneration to update static pages after they've been built, without rebuilding your entire site.\n- **[Static Images](/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/static-assets):** Use the `public` directory to automatically cache your application's static assets, e.g. images.\n\n</PagesOnly>\n\n### UI and accessibility\n\n<AppOnly>\n\n- **[Forms and Validation](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions-and-mutations#forms):** Use Server Actions to handle form submissions, server-side validation, and handle errors.\n\n</AppOnly>\n\n- **[Font Module](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts):** Optimize fonts by using the Font Module, which automatically hosts your font files with other static assets, removes external network requests, and reduces [layout shift](https://web.dev/articles/cls).\n- **[`<Image>` Component](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/images):** Optimize images by using the Image Component, which automatically optimizes images, prevents layout shift, and serves them in modern formats like WebP or AVIF.\n- **[`<Script>` Component](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/scripts):** Optimize third-party scripts by using the Script Component, which automatically defers scripts and prevents them from blocking the main thread.\n- **[ESLint](/docs/architecture/accessibility#linting):** Use the built-in `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y` plugin to catch accessibility issues early.\n\n### Security\n\n<AppOnly>\n\n- **[Tainting](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/fetching#preventing-sensitive-data-from-being-exposed-to-the-client):** Prevent sensitive data from being exposed to the client by tainting data objects and/or specific values.\n- **[Server Actions](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions-and-mutations#authentication-and-authorization):** Ensure users are authorized to call Server Actions.

You can use the `<PagesOnly>Content</PagesOnly>` component to add content that is specific to the Pages Router. Any shared content should not be wrapped in a component. */}\n\nNext.js enables starting as a static site or Single-Page Application (SPA), then later optionally upgrading to use features that require a server.\n\nWhen running `next build`, Next.js generates an HTML file per route. By breaking a strict SPA into individual HTML files, Next.js can avoid loading unnecessary JavaScript code on the client-side, reducing the bundle size and enabling faster page loads.\n\nSince Next.js supports this static export, it can be deployed and hosted on any web server that can serve HTML/CSS/JS static assets.\n\n<PagesOnly>\n\n> **Good to know**: We recommend using the App Router for enhanced static export support.\n\n</PagesOnly>\n\n## Configuration\n\nTo enable a static export, change the output mode inside `next.config.js`:\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\" highlight={5}\n/**\n * @type {import('next').NextConfig}\n */\nconst nextConfig = {\n  output: 'export',\n\n  // Optional: Change links `/me` -> `/me/` and emit `/me.html` -> `/me/index.html`\n  // trailingSlash: true,\n\n  // Optional: Prevent automatic `/me` -> `/me/`, instead preserve `href`\n  // skipTrailingSlashRedirect: true,\n\n  // Optional: Change the output directory `out` -> `dist`\n  // distDir: 'dist',\n}\n\nmodule.exports = nextConfig\n```\n\nAfter running `next build`, Next.js will produce an `out` folder which contains the HTML/CSS/JS assets for your application.\n\n<PagesOnly>\n\nYou can utilize [`getStaticProps`](/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-static-props) and [`getStaticPaths`](/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-static-paths) to generate an HTML file for each page in your `pages` directory (or more for [dynamic routes](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes)).\n\n</PagesOnly>\n\n<AppOnly>\n\n## Supported Features\n\nThe core of Next.js has been designed to support static exports.\n\n### Server Components\n\nWhen you run `next build` to generate a static export, Server Components consumed inside the `app` directory will run during the build, similar to traditional static-site generation.\n\nThe resulting component will be rendered into static HTML for the initial page load and a static payload for client navigation between routes. No changes are required for your Server Components when using the static export, unless they consume [dynamic server functions](#unsupported-features).\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/page.tsx\" switcher\nexport default async function Page() {\n  // This fetch will run on the server during `next build`\n  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/...')\n  const data = await res.json()\n\n  return <main>...</main>\n}\n```\n\n### Client Components\n\nIf you want to perform data fetching on the client, you can use a Client Component with [SWR](https://github.com/vercel/swr) to memoize requests.\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/other/page.tsx\" switcher\n'use client'\n\nimport useSWR from 'swr'\n\nconst fetcher = (url: string) => fetch(url).then((r) => r.json())\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  const { data, error } = useSWR(\n    `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1`,\n    fetcher\n  )\n  if (error) return 'Failed to load'\n  if (!data) return 'Loading...'\n\n  return data.title\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/other/page.js\" switcher\n'use client'\n\nimport useSWR from 'swr'\n\nconst fetcher = (url) => fetch(url).then((r) => r.json())\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  const { data, error } = useSWR(\n    `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1`,\n    fetcher\n  )\n  if (error) return 'Failed to load'\n  if (!data) return 'Loading...'\n\n  return data.title\n}\n```\n\nSince route transitions happen client-side, this behaves like a traditional SPA. For example, the following index route allows you to navigate to different posts on the client:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/page.tsx\" switcher\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h1>Index Page</h1>\n      <hr />\n      <ul>\n        <li>\n          <Link href=\"/post/1\">Post 1</Link>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          <Link href=\"/post/2\">Post 2</Link>\n        </li>\n      </ul>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/page.js\" switcher\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h1>Index Page</h1>\n      <p>\n        <Link href=\"/other\">Other Page</Link>\n      </p>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n</AppOnly>\n\n<PagesOnly>\n\n## Supported Features\n\nThe majority of core Next.js features needed to build a static site are supported, including:\n\n- [Dynamic Routes when using `getStaticPaths`](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes)\n- Prefetching with `next/link`\n- Preloading JavaScript\n- [Dynamic Imports](/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/lazy-loading)\n- Any styling options (e.g. CSS Modules, styled-jsx)\n- [Client-side data fetching](/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/client-side)\n- [`getStaticProps`](/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-static-props)\n- [`getStaticPaths`](/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-static-paths)\n\n</PagesOnly>\n\n### Image Optimization\n\n[Image Optimization](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/images) through `next/image` can be used with a static export by defining a custom image loader in `next.config.js`. For example, you can optimize images with a service like Cloudinary:\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\n/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */\nconst nextConfig = {\n  output: 'export',\n  images: {\n    loader: 'custom',\n    loaderFile: './my-loader.ts',\n  },\n}\n\nmodule.exports = nextConfig\n```\n\nThis custom loader will define how to fetch images from a remote source. For example, the following loader will construct the URL for Cloudinary:\n\n```ts filename=\"my-loader.ts\" switcher\nexport default function cloudinaryLoader({\n  src,\n  width,\n  quality,\n}: {\n  src: string\n  width: number\n  quality?: number\n}) {\n  const params = ['f_auto', 'c_limit', `w_${width}`, `q_${quality || 'auto'}`]\n  return `https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/${params.join(\n    ','\n  )}${src}`\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"my-loader.js\" switcher\nexport default function cloudinaryLoader({ src, width, quality }) {\n  const params = ['f_auto', 'c_limit', `w_${width}`, `q_${quality || 'auto'}`]\n  return `https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/${params.join(\n    ','\n  )}${src}`\n}\n```\n\nYou can then use `next/image` in your application, defining relative paths to the image in Cloudinary:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/page.tsx\" switcher\nimport Image from 'next/image'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return <Image alt=\"turtles\" src=\"/turtles.jpg\" width={300} height={300} />\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/page.js\" switcher\nimport Image from 'next/image'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return <Image alt=\"turtles\" src=\"/turtles.jpg\" width={300} height={300} />\n}\n```\n\n<AppOnly>\n\n### Route Handlers\n\nRoute Handlers will render a static response when running `next build`. Only the `GET` HTTP verb is supported. This can be used to generate static HTML, JSON, TXT, or other files from cached or uncached data. For example:\n\n```ts filename=\"app/data.json/route.ts\" switcher\nexport async function GET() {\n  return Response.json({ name: 'Lee' })\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"app/data.json/route.js\" switcher\nexport async function GET() {\n  return Response.json({ name: 'Lee' })\n}\n```\n\nThe above file `app/data.json/route.ts` will render to a static file during `next build`, producing `data.json` containing `{ name: 'Lee' }`.\n\nIf you need to read dynamic values from the incoming request, you cannot use a static export.\n\n### Browser APIs\n\nClient Components are pre-rendered to HTML during `next build`. Because [Web APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API) like `window`, `localStorage`, and `navigator` are not available on the server, you need to safely access these APIs only when running in the browser. For example:\n\n```jsx\n'use client';\n\nimport { useEffect } from 'react';\n\nexport default function ClientComponent() {\n  useEffect(() => {\n    // You now have access to `window`\n    console.log(window.innerHeight);\n  }, [])\n\n  return ...;\n}\n```\n\n</AppOnly>\n\n## Unsupported Features\n\nFeatures that require a Node.js server, or dynamic logic that cannot be computed during the build process, are **not** supported:\n\n<AppOnly>\n\n- [Dynamic Routes](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes) with `dynamicParams: true`\n- [Dynamic Routes](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes) without `generateStaticParams()`\n- [Route Handlers](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-handlers) that rely on Request\n- [Cookies](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/cookies)\n- [Rewrites](/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/rewrites)\n- [Redirects](/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/redirects)\n- [Headers](/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/headers)\n- [Middleware](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware)\n- [Incremental Static Regeneration](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/caching-and-revalidating)\n- [Image Optimization](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/images) with the default `loader`\n- [Draft Mode](/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/draft-mode)\n\nAttempting to use any of these features with `next dev` will result in an error, similar to setting the [`dynamic`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/route-segment-config#dynamic) option to `error` in the root layout.\n\n```jsx\nexport const dynamic = 'error'\n```\n\n</AppOnly>\n\n<PagesOnly>\n\n- [Internationalized Routing](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/internationalization)\n- [API Routes](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes)\n- [Rewrites](/docs/pages/api-reference/next-config-js/rewrites)\n- [Redirects](/docs/pages/api-reference/next-config-js/redirects)\n- [Headers](/docs/pages/api-reference/next-config-js/headers)\n- [Middleware](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/middleware)\n- [Incremental Static Regeneration](/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/incremental-static-regeneration)\n- [Image Optimization](/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/images) with the default `loader`\n- [Draft Mode](/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/draft-mode)\n- [`getStaticPaths` with `fallback: true`](/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/get-static-paths#fallback-true)\n- [`getStaticPaths` with `fallback: 'blocking'`](/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/get-static-paths#fallback-blocking)\n- [`getServerSideProps`](/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-server-side-props)\n\n</PagesOnly>\n\n## Deploying\n\nWith a static export, Next.js can be deployed and hosted on any web server that can serve HTML/CSS/JS static assets.\n\nWhen running `next build`, Next.js generates the static export into the `out` folder. For example, let's say you have the following routes:\n\n- `/`\n- `/blog/[id]`\n\nAfter running `next build`, Next.js will generate the following files:\n\n- `/out/index.html`\n- `/out/404.html`\n- `/out/blog/post-1.html`\n- `/out/blog/post-2.html`\n\nIf you are using a static host like Nginx, you can configure rewrites from incoming requests to the correct files:\n\n```nginx filename=\"nginx.conf\"\nserver {\n  listen 80;\n  server_name acme.com;\n\n  root /var/www/out;\n\n  location / {\n      try_files $uri $uri.html $uri/ =404;\n  }\n\n  # This is necessary when `trailingSlash: false`.\n  # You can omit this when `trailingSlash: true`.\n  location /blog/ {\n      rewrite ^/blog/(.*)$ /blog/$1.html break;\n  }\n\n  error_page 404 /404.html;\n  location = /404.html {\n      internal;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Version History\n\n| Version   | Changes                                                                                                              |\n| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `v14.0.0` | `next export` has been removed in favor of `\"output\": \"export\"`                                                      |\n| `v13.4.0` | App Router (Stable) adds enhanced static export support, including using React Server Components and Route Handlers. |\n| `v13.3.0` | `next export` is deprecated and replaced with `\"output\": \"export\"`                                                   |\n"},{"path":"docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/10-deploying/index.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/10-deploying/index.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying","sha":"2f410be3cba2210cb916179625b47fc3773e8808","size":16508,"content":"---\ntitle: Deploying\ndescription: Learn how to deploy your Next.js app to production, either managed or self-hosted.\n---\n\n{/* The content of this doc is shared between the app and pages router. You can use the `<PagesOnly>Content</PagesOnly>` component to add content that is specific to the Pages Router. Any shared content should not be wrapped in a component. */}\n\nCongratulations, it's time to ship to production.\n\nYou can deploy [managed Next.js with Vercel](#managed-nextjs-with-vercel), or self-host on a Node.js server, Docker image, or even static HTML files. When deploying using `next start`, all Next.js features are supported.\n\n## Production Builds\n\nRunning `next build` generates an optimized version of your application for production. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files are created based on your pages. JavaScript is **compiled** and browser bundles are **minified** using the [Next.js Compiler](/docs/architecture/nextjs-compiler) to help achieve the best performance and support [all modern browsers](/docs/architecture/supported-browsers).\n\nNext.js produces a standard deployment output used by managed and self-hosted Next.js. This ensures all features are supported across both methods of deployment. In the next major version, we will be transforming this output into our [Build Output API specification](https://vercel.com/docs/build-output-api/v3?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=next-website).\n\n## Managed Next.js with Vercel\n\n[Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/frameworks/nextjs?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=next-website), the creators and maintainers of Next.js, provide managed infrastructure and a developer experience platform for your Next.js applications.\n\nDeploying to Vercel is zero-configuration and provides additional enhancements for scalability, availability, and performance globally. However, all Next.js features are still supported when self-hosted.\n\nLearn more about [Next.js on Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/frameworks/nextjs?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=next-website) or [deploy a template for free](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=next-website) to try it out.\n\n## Self-Hosting\n\nYou can self-host Next.js in three different ways:\n\n- [A Node.js server](#nodejs-server)\n- [A Docker container](#docker-image)\n- [A static export](#static-html-export)\n\n### Node.js Server\n\nNext.js can be deployed to any hosting provider that supports Node.js. Ensure your `package.json` has the `\"build\"` and `\"start\"` scripts:\n\n```json filename=\"package.json\"\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"dev\": \"next dev\",\n    \"build\": \"next build\",\n    \"start\": \"next start\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThen, run `npm run build` to build your application. Finally, run `npm run start` to start the Node.js server. This server supports all Next.js features.\n\n### Docker Image\n\nNext.js can be deployed to any hosting provider that supports [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) containers. You can use this approach when deploying to container orchestrators such as [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) or when running inside a container in any cloud provider.\n\n1. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) on your machine\n2. [Clone our example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-docker) (or the [multi-environment example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-docker-multi-env))\n3. Build your container: `docker build -t nextjs-docker .`\n4. Run your container: `docker run -p 3000:3000 nextjs-docker`\n\nNext.js through Docker supports all Next.js features.\n\n### Static HTML Export\n\nNext.js enables starting as a static site or Single-Page Application (SPA), then later optionally upgrading to use features that require a server.\n\nSince Next.js supports this [static export](/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports), it can be deployed and hosted on any web server that can serve HTML/CSS/JS static assets. This includes tools like AWS S3, Nginx, or Apache.\n\nRunning as a [static export](/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports) does not support Next.js features that require a server. [Learn more](/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports#unsupported-features).\n\n> **Good to know:**\n>\n> - [Server Components](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components) are supported with static exports.\n\n## Features\n\n### Image Optimization\n\n[Image Optimization](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/images) through `next/image` works self-hosted with zero configuration when deploying using `next start`. If you would prefer to have a separate service to optimize images, you can [configure an image loader](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/images#loaders).\n\nImage Optimization can be used with a [static export](/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports#image-optimization) by defining a custom image loader in `next.config.js`. Note that images are optimized at runtime, not during the build.\n\n> **Good to know:**\n>\n> - On glibc-based Linux systems, Image Optimization may require [additional configuration](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/install#linux-memory-allocator) to prevent excessive memory usage.\n> - Learn more about the [caching behavior of optimized images](/docs/app/api-reference/components/image#caching-behavior) and how to configure the TTL.\n> - You can also [disable Image Optimization](/docs/app/api-reference/components/image#unoptimized) and still retain other benefits of using `next/image` if you prefer. For example, if you are optimizing images yourself separately.\n\n### Middleware\n\n[Middleware](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware) works self-hosted with zero configuration when deploying using `next start`. Since it requires access to the incoming request, it is not supported when using a [static export](/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports).\n\nMiddleware uses a [runtime](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/edge-and-nodejs-runtimes) that is a subset of all available Node.js APIs to help ensure low latency, since it may run in front of every route or asset in your application. This runtime does not require running “at the edge” and works in a single-region server. Additional configuration and infrastructure are required to run Middleware in multiple regions.\n\nIf you are looking to add logic (or use an external package) that requires all Node.js APIs, you might be able to move this logic to a [layout](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/layouts-and-templates#layouts) as a [Server Component](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components). For example, checking [headers](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/headers) and [redirecting](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/redirect). You can also use headers, cookies, or query parameters to [redirect](/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/redirects#header-cookie-and-query-matching) or [rewrite](/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/rewrites#header-cookie-and-query-matching) through `next.config.js`. If that does not work, you can also use a [custom server](/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/custom-server).\n\n### Environment Variables\n\nNext.js can support both build time and runtime environment variables.\n\n**By default, environment variables are only available on the server**. To expose an environment variable to the browser, it must be prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`. However, these public environment variables will be inlined into the JavaScript bundle during `next build`.\n\nTo read runtime environment variables, we recommend using `getServerSideProps` or [incrementally adopting the App Router](/docs/app/building-your-application/upgrading/app-router-migration). With the App Router, we can safely read environment variables on the server during dynamic rendering. This allows you to use a singular Docker image that can be promoted through multiple environments with different values.\n\n```jsx\nimport { unstable_noStore as noStore } from 'next/cache';\n\nexport default function Component() {\n  noStore();\n  // cookies(), headers(), and other dynamic functions\n  // will also opt into dynamic rendering, making\n  // this env variable is evaluated at runtime\n  const value = process.env.MY_VALUE\n  ...\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know:**\n>\n> - You can run code on server startup using the [`register` function](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/instrumentation).\n> - We do not recommend using the [runtimeConfig](/docs/pages/api-reference/next-config-js/runtime-configuration) option, as this does not work with the standalone output mode. Instead, we recommend [incrementally adopting](/docs/app/building-your-application/upgrading/app-router-migration) the App Router.\n\n### Caching and ISR\n\nNext.js can cache responses, generated static pages, build outputs, and other static assets like images, fonts, and scripts.\n\nCaching and revalidating pages (using Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) or newer functions in the App Router) use the **same shared cache**. By default, this cache is stored to the filesystem (on disk) on your Next.js server. **This works automatically when self-hosting** using both the Pages and App Router.\n\nYou can configure the Next.js cache location if you want to persist cached pages and data to durable storage, or share the cache across multiple containers or instances of your Next.js application.\n\n#### Automatic Caching\n\n- Next.js sets the `Cache-Control` header of `public, max-age=31536000, immutable` to truly immutable assets. It cannot be overridden. These immutable files contain a SHA-hash in the file name, so they can be safely cached indefinitely. For example, [Static Image Imports](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/images#local-images). You can [configure the TTL](/docs/app/api-reference/components/image#caching-behavior) for images.\n- Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) sets the `Cache-Control` header of `s-maxage: <revalidate in getStaticProps>, stale-while-revalidate`. This revalidation time is defined in your [`getStaticProps` function](/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-static-props) in seconds. If you set `revalidate: false`, it will default to a one-year cache duration.\n- Dynamically rendered pages set a `Cache-Control` header of `private, no-cache, no-store, max-age=0, must-revalidate` to prevent user-specific data from being cached. This applies to both the App Router and Pages Router. This also includes [Draft Mode](/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/draft-mode).\n\n#### Static Assets\n\nIf you want to host static assets on a different domain or CDN, you can use the `assetPrefix` [configuration](/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/assetPrefix) in `next.config.js`. Next.js will use this asset prefix when retrieving JavaScript or CSS files. Separating your assets to a different domain does come with the downside of extra time spent on DNS and TLS resolution.\n\n[Learn more about `assetPrefix`](/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/assetPrefix).\n\n#### Configuring Caching\n\nBy default, generated cache assets will be stored in memory (defaults to 50mb) and on disk. If you are hosting Next.js using a container orchestration platform like Kubernetes, each pod will have a copy of the cache. To prevent stale data from being shown since the cache is not shared between pods by default, you can configure the Next.js cache to provide a cache handler and disable in-memory caching.\n\nTo configure the ISR/Data Cache location when self-hosting, you can configure a custom handler in your `next.config.js` file:\n\n```jsx filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  cacheHandler: require.resolve('./cache-handler.js'),\n  cacheMaxMemorySize: 0, // disable default in-memory caching\n}\n```\n\nThen, create `cache-handler.js` in the root of your project, for example:\n\n```jsx filename=\"cache-handler.js\"\nconst cache = new Map()\n\nmodule.exports = class CacheHandler {\n  constructor(options) {\n    this.options = options\n  }\n\n  async get(key) {\n    // This could be stored anywhere, like durable storage\n    return cache.get(key)\n  }\n\n  async set(key, data, ctx) {\n    // This could be stored anywhere, like durable storage\n    cache.set(key, {\n      value: data,\n      lastModified: Date.now(),\n      tags: ctx.tags,\n    })\n  }\n\n  async revalidateTag(tag) {\n    // Iterate over all entries in the cache\n    for (let [key, value] of cache) {\n      // If the value's tags include the specified tag, delete this entry\n      if (value.tags.includes(tag)) {\n        cache.delete(key)\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nUsing a custom cache handler will allow you to ensure consistency across all pods hosting your Next.js application. For instance, you can save the cached values anywhere, like [Redis](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/cache-handler-redis) or AWS S3.\n\n> **Good to know:**\n>\n> - `revalidatePath` is a convenience layer on top of cache tags. Calling `revalidatePath` will call the `revalidateTag` function with a special default tag for the provided page.\n\n### Build Cache\n\nNext.js generates an ID during `next build` to identify which version of your application is being served. The same build should be used and boot up multiple containers.\n\nIf you are rebuilding for each stage of your environment, you will need to generate a consistent build ID to use between containers. Use the `generateBuildId` command in `next.config.js`:\n\n```jsx filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  generateBuildId: async () => {\n    // This could be anything, using the latest git hash\n    return process.env.GIT_HASH\n  },\n}\n```\n\n### Version Skew\n\nNext.js will automatically mitigate most instances of [version skew](https://www.industrialempathy.com/posts/version-skew/) and automatically reload the application to retrieve new assets when detected. For example, if there is a mismatch in the `deploymentId`, transitions between pages will perform a hard navigation versus using a prefetched value.\n\nWhen the application is reloaded, there may be a loss of application state if it's not designed to persist between page navigations. For example, using URL state or local storage would persist state after a page refresh. However, component state like `useState` would be lost in such navigations.\n\nVercel provides additional [skew protection](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/skew-protection?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=next-website) for Next.js applications to ensure assets and functions from the previous version are still available to older clients, even after the new version is deployed.\n\nYou can manually configure the `deploymentId` property in your `next.config.js` file to ensure each request uses either `?dpl` query string or `x-deployment-id` header.\n\n<AppOnly>\n\n### Streaming and Suspense\n\nThe Next.js App Router supports [streaming responses](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/loading-ui-and-streaming) when self-hosting. If you are using Nginx or a similar proxy, you will need to configure it to disable buffering to enable streaming.\n\nFor example, you can disable buffering in Nginx by setting `X-Accel-Buffering` to `no`:\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  async headers() {\n    return [\n      {\n        source: '/:path*{/}?',\n        headers: [\n          {\n            key: 'X-Accel-Buffering',\n            value: 'no',\n          },\n        ],\n      },\n    ]\n  },\n}\n```\n\n</AppOnly>\n\n<PagesOnly>\n\n## Manual Graceful Shutdowns\n\nWhen self-hosting, you might want to run code when the server shuts down on `SIGTERM` or `SIGINT` signals.\n\nYou can set the env variable `NEXT_MANUAL_SIG_HANDLE` to `true` and then register a handler for that signal inside your `_document.js` file. You will need to register the environment variable directly in the `package.json` script, and not in the `.env` file.\n\n> **Good to know**: Manual signal handling is not available in `next dev`.\n\n```json filename=\"package.json\"\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"dev\": \"next dev\",\n    \"build\": \"next build\",\n    \"start\": \"NEXT_MANUAL_SIG_HANDLE=true next start\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"pages/_document.js\"\nif (process.env.NEXT_MANUAL_SIG_HANDLE) {\n  process.on('SIGTERM', () => {\n    console.log('Received SIGTERM: cleaning up')\n    process.exit(0)\n  })\n  process.on('SIGINT', () => {\n    console.log('Received SIGINT: cleaning up')\n    process.exit(0)\n  })\n}\n```\n\n</PagesOnly>\n"},{"path":"docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/09-authentication/index.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/09-authentication/index.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/authentication","sha":"bf529841f0a9b5ccd944fbd34b9f9b30d866a1ad","size":53786,"content":"---\ntitle: Authentication\ndescription: Learn how to implement authentication in your Next.js application.\n---\n\nUnderstanding authentication is crucial for protecting your application's data. This page will guide you through what React and Next.js features to use to implement auth.\n\nBefore starting, it helps to break down the process into three concepts:\n\n1. **[Authentication](#authentication)**: Verifies if the user is who they say they are. It requires the user to prove their identity with something they have, such as a username and password.\n2. **[Session Management](#session-management)**: Tracks the user's auth state across requests.\n3. **[Authorization](#authorization)**: Decides what routes and data the user can access.\n\nThis diagram shows the authentication flow using React and Next.js features:\n\n<Image\n  alt=\"Diagram showing the authentication flow with React and Next.js features\"\n  srcLight=\"/docs/light/authentication-overview.png\"\n  srcDark=\"/docs/dark/authentication-overview.png\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"1383\"\n/>\n\nThe examples on this page walk through basic username and password auth for educational purposes. While you can implement a custom auth solution, for increased security and simplicity, we recommend using an authentication library. These offer built-in solutions for authentication, session management, and authorization, as well as additional features such as social logins, multi-factor authentication, and role-based access control. You can find a list in the [Auth Libraries](#auth-libraries) section.\n\n## Authentication\n\n<AppOnly>\n\n### Sign-up and login functionality\n\nYou can use the [`<form>`](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/components/form) element with React's [Server Actions](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions-and-mutations) and [`useActionState()`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useActionState) to capture user credentials, validate form fields, and call your Authentication Provider's API or database.\n\nSince Server Actions always execute on the server, they provide a secure environment for handling authentication logic.\n\nHere are the steps to implement signup/login functionality:\n\n#### 1. Capture user credentials\n\nTo capture user credentials, create a form that invokes a Server Action on submission. For example, a signup form that accepts the user's name, email, and password:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/ui/signup-form.tsx\" switcher\nimport { signup } from '@/app/actions/auth'\n\nexport function SignupForm() {\n  return (\n    <form action={signup}>\n      <div>\n        <label htmlFor=\"name\">Name</label>\n        <input id=\"name\" name=\"name\" placeholder=\"Name\" />\n      </div>\n      <div>\n        <label htmlFor=\"email\">Email</label>\n        <input id=\"email\" name=\"email\" type=\"email\" placeholder=\"Email\" />\n      </div>\n      <div>\n        <label htmlFor=\"password\">Password</label>\n        <input id=\"password\" name=\"password\" type=\"password\" />\n      </div>\n      <button type=\"submit\">Sign Up</button>\n    </form>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/ui/signup-form.js\" switcher\nimport { signup } from '@/app/actions/auth'\n\nexport function SignupForm() {\n  return (\n    <form action={signup}>\n      <div>\n        <label htmlFor=\"name\">Name</label>\n        <input id=\"name\" name=\"name\" placeholder=\"Name\" />\n      </div>\n      <div>\n        <label htmlFor=\"email\">Email</label>\n        <input id=\"email\" name=\"email\" type=\"email\" placeholder=\"Email\" />\n      </div>\n      <div>\n        <label htmlFor=\"password\">Password</label>\n        <input id=\"password\" name=\"password\" type=\"password\" />\n      </div>\n      <button type=\"submit\">Sign Up</button>\n    </form>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/actions/auth.tsx\" switcher\nexport async function signup(formData: FormData) {}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/actions/auth.js\" switcher\nexport async function signup(formData) {}\n```\n\n#### 2. Validate form fields on the server\n\nUse the Server Action to validate the form fields on the server. If your authentication provider doesn't provide form validation, you can use a schema validation library like [Zod](https://zod.dev/) or [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup).\n\nUsing Zod as an example, you can define a form schema with appropriate error messages:\n\n```ts filename=\"app/lib/definitions.ts\" switcher\nimport { z } from 'zod'\n\nexport const SignupFormSchema = z.object({\n  name: z\n    .string()\n    .min(2, { message: 'Name must be at least 2 characters long.' })\n    .trim(),\n  email: z.string().email({ message: 'Please enter a valid email.' }).trim(),\n  password: z\n    .string()\n    .min(8, { message: 'Be at least 8 characters long' })\n    .regex(/[a-zA-Z]/, { message: 'Contain at least one letter.' })\n    .regex(/[0-9]/, { message: 'Contain at least one number.' })\n    .regex(/[^a-zA-Z0-9]/, {\n      message: 'Contain at least one special character.',\n    })\n    .trim(),\n})\n\nexport type FormState =\n  | {\n      errors?: {\n        name?: string[]\n        email?: string[]\n        password?: string[]\n      }\n      message?: string\n    }\n  | undefined\n```\n\n```js filename=\"app/lib/definitions.js\" switcher\nimport { z } from 'zod'\n\nexport const SignupFormSchema = z.object({\n  name: z\n    .string()\n    .min(2, { message: 'Name must be at least 2 characters long.' })\n    .trim(),\n  email: z.string().email({ message: 'Please enter a valid email.' }).trim(),\n  password: z\n    .string()\n    .min(8, { message: 'Be at least 8 characters long' })\n    .regex(/[a-zA-Z]/, { message: 'Contain at least one letter.' })\n    .regex(/[0-9]/, { message: 'Contain at least one number.' })\n    .regex(/[^a-zA-Z0-9]/, {\n      message: 'Contain at least one special character.',\n    })\n    .trim(),\n})\n```\n\nTo prevent unnecessary calls to your authentication provider's API or database, you can `return` early in the Server Action if any form fields do not match the defined schema.\n\n```ts filename=\"app/actions/auth.ts\" switcher\nimport { SignupFormSchema, FormState } from '@/app/lib/definitions'\n\nexport async function signup(state: FormState, formData) {\n  // Validate form fields\n  const validatedFields = SignupFormSchema.safeParse({\n    name: formData.get('name'),\n    email: formData.get('email'),\n    password: formData.get('password'),\n  })\n\n  // If any form fields are invalid, return early\n  if (!validatedFields.success) {\n    return {\n      errors: validatedFields.error.flatten().fieldErrors,\n    }\n  }\n\n  // Call the provider or db to create a user...\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"app/actions/auth.js\" switcher\nimport { SignupFormSchema } from '@/app/lib/definitions'\n\nexport async function signup(state, formData) {\n  // Validate form fields\n  const validatedFields = SignupFormSchema.safeParse({\n    name: formData.get('name'),\n    email: formData.get('email'),\n    password: formData.get('password'),\n  })\n\n  // If any form fields are invalid, return early\n  if (!validatedFields.success) {\n    return {\n      errors: validatedFields.error.flatten().fieldErrors,\n    }\n  }\n\n  // Call the provider or db to create a user...\n}\n```\n\nBack in your `<SignupForm />`, you can use React's `useActionState()` hook to display validation errors and a pending state while the form is submitting:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/ui/signup-form.tsx\" switcher highlight={7,15,21,27-39}\n'use client'\n\nimport { useActionState } from 'react'\nimport { signup } from '@/app/actions/auth'\n\nexport function SignupForm() {\n  const [state, action] = useActionState(signup, undefined)\n\n  return (\n    <form action={action}>\n      <div>\n        <label htmlFor=\"name\">Name</label>\n        <input id=\"name\" name=\"name\" placeholder=\"Name\" />\n      </div>\n      {state?.errors?.name && <p>{state.errors.name}</p>}\n\n      <div>\n        <label htmlFor=\"email\">Email</label>\n        <input id=\"email\" name=\"email\" placeholder=\"Email\" />\n      </div>\n      {state?.errors?.email && <p>{state.errors.email}</p>}\n\n      <div>\n        <label htmlFor=\"password\">Password</label>\n        <input id=\"password\" name=\"password\" type=\"password\" />\n      </div>\n      {state?.errors?.password && (\n        <div>\n          <p>Password must:</p>\n          <ul>\n            {state.errors.password.map((error) => (\n              <li key={error}>- {error}</li>\n            ))}\n          </ul>\n        </div>\n      )}\n      <button aria-disabled={pending} type=\"submit\">\n        {pending ? 'Submitting...' : 'Sign up'}\n      </button>\n    </form>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/ui/signup-form.js\" switcher highlight={7,15,21,27-39}\n'use client'\n\nimport { useActionState } from 'react'\nimport { signup } from '@/app/actions/auth'\n\nexport function SignupForm() {\n  const [state, action] = useActionState(signup, undefined)\n\n  return (\n    <form action={action}>\n      <div>\n        <label htmlFor=\"name\">Name</label>\n        <input id=\"name\" name=\"name\" placeholder=\"John Doe\" />\n      </div>\n      {state.errors.name && <p>{state.errors.name}</p>}\n\n      <div>\n        <label htmlFor=\"email\">Email</label>\n        <input id=\"email\" name=\"email\" placeholder=\"john@example.com\" />\n      </div>\n      {state.errors.email && <p>{state.errors.email}</p>}\n\n      <div>\n        <label htmlFor=\"password\">Password</label>\n        <input id=\"password\" name=\"password\" type=\"password\" />\n      </div>\n      {state.errors.password && (\n        <div>\n          <p>Password must:</p>\n          <ul>\n            {state.errors.password.map((error) => (\n              <li key={error}>- {error}</li>\n            ))}\n          </ul>\n        </div>\n      )}\n      <button aria-disabled={pending} type=\"submit\">\n        {pending ? 'Submitting...' : 'Sign up'}\n      </button>\n    </form>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know:** Alternatively, you can use the [`useFormStatus`](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/hooks/useFormStatus) hook to display the pending state.\n\n#### 3. Create a user or check user credentials\n\nAfter validating form fields, you can create a new user account or check if the user exists by calling your authentication provider's API or database.\n\nContinuing from the previous example:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/actions/auth.tsx\" switcher\nexport async function signup(state: FormState, formData: FormData) {\n  // 1. Validate form fields\n  // ...\n\n  // 2. Prepare data for insertion into database\n  const { name, email, password } = validatedFields.data\n  // e.g. Hash the user's password before storing it\n  const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(password, 10)\n\n  // 3. Insert the user into the database or call an Auth Library's API\n  const data = await db\n    .insert(users)\n    .values({\n      name,\n      email,\n      password: hashedPassword,\n    })\n    .returning({ id: users.id })\n\n  const user = data[0]\n\n  if (!user) {\n    return {\n      message: 'An error occurred while creating your account.',\n    }\n  }\n\n  // TODO:\n  // 4. Create user session\n  // 5. Redirect user\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/actions/auth.js\" switcher\nexport async function signup(state, formData) {\n  // 1. Validate form fields\n  // ...\n\n  // 2. Prepare data for insertion into database\n  const { name, email, password } = validatedFields.data\n  // e.g. Hash the user's password before storing it\n  const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(password, 10)\n\n  // 3. Insert the user into the database or call an Library API\n  const data = await db\n    .insert(users)\n    .values({\n      name,\n      email,\n      password: hashedPassword,\n    })\n    .returning({ id: users.id })\n\n  const user = data[0]\n\n  if (!user) {\n    return {\n      message: 'An error occurred while creating your account.',\n    }\n  }\n\n  // TODO:\n  // 4. Create user session\n  // 5. Redirect user\n}\n```\n\nAfter successfully creating the user account or verifying the user credentials, you can create a session to manage the user's auth state. Depending on your session management strategy, the session can be stored in a cookie or database, or both. Continue to the [Session Management](#session-management) section to learn more.\n\n> **Tips:**\n>\n> - The example above is verbose since it breaks down the authentication steps for the purpose of education. This highlights that implementing your own secure solution can quickly become complex. Consider using an [Auth Library](#auth-libraries) to simplify the process.\n> - To improve the user experience, you may want to check for duplicate emails or usernames earlier in the registration flow. For example, as the user types in a username or the input field loses focus. This can help prevent unnecessary form submissions and provide immediate feedback to the user. You can debounce requests with libraries such as [use-debounce](https://www.npmjs.com/package/use-debounce) to manage the frequency of these checks.\n\n</AppOnly>\n\n<PagesOnly>\n\nHere are the steps to implement a sign-up and/or login form:\n\n1. The user submits their credentials through a form.\n2. The form sends a request that is handled by an API route.\n3. Upon successful verification, the process is completed, indicating the user's successful authentication.\n4. If verification is unsuccessful, an error message is shown.\n\nConsider a login form where users can input their credentials:\n\n```tsx filename=\"pages/login.tsx\" switcher\nimport { FormEvent } from 'react'\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/router'\n\nexport default function LoginPage() {\n  const router = useRouter()\n\n  async function handleSubmit(event: FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) {\n    event.preventDefault()\n\n    const formData = new FormData(event.currentTarget)\n    const email = formData.get('email')\n    const password = formData.get('password')\n\n    const response = await fetch('/api/auth/login', {\n      method: 'POST',\n      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },\n      body: JSON.stringify({ email, password }),\n    })\n\n    if (response.ok) {\n      router.push('/profile')\n    } else {\n      // Handle errors\n    }\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>\n      <input type=\"email\" name=\"email\" placeholder=\"Email\" required />\n      <input type=\"password\" name=\"password\" placeholder=\"Password\" required />\n      <button type=\"submit\">Login</button>\n    </form>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"pages/login.jsx\" switcher\nimport { FormEvent } from 'react'\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/router'\n\nexport default function LoginPage() {\n  const router = useRouter()\n\n  async function handleSubmit(event) {\n    event.preventDefault()\n\n    const formData = new FormData(event.currentTarget)\n    const email = formData.get('email')\n    const password = formData.get('password')\n\n    const response = await fetch('/api/auth/login', {\n      method: 'POST',\n      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },\n      body: JSON.stringify({ email, password }),\n    })\n\n    if (response.ok) {\n      router.push('/profile')\n    } else {\n      // Handle errors\n    }\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>\n      <input type=\"email\" name=\"email\" placeholder=\"Email\" required />\n      <input type=\"password\" name=\"password\" placeholder=\"Password\" required />\n      <button type=\"submit\">Login</button>\n    </form>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nThe form above has two input fields for capturing the user's email and password. On submission, it triggers a function that sends a POST request to an API route (`/api/auth/login`).\n\nYou can then call your Authentication Provider's API in the API route to handle authentication:\n\n```ts filename=\"pages/api/auth/login.ts\" switcher\nimport type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next'\nimport { signIn } from '@/auth'\n\nexport default async function handler(\n  req: NextApiRequest,\n  res: NextApiResponse\n) {\n  try {\n    const { email, password } = req.body\n    await signIn('credentials', { email, password })\n\n    res.status(200).json({ success: true })\n  } catch (error) {\n    if (error.type === 'CredentialsSignin') {\n      res.status(401).json({ error: 'Invalid credentials.' })\n    } else {\n      res.status(500).json({ error: 'Something went wrong.' })\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"pages/api/auth/login.js\" switcher\nimport { signIn } from '@/auth'\n\nexport default async function handler(req, res) {\n  try {\n    const { email, password } = req.body\n    await signIn('credentials', { email, password })\n\n    res.status(200).json({ success: true })\n  } catch (error) {\n    if (error.type === 'CredentialsSignin') {\n      res.status(401).json({ error: 'Invalid credentials.' })\n    } else {\n      res.status(500).json({ error: 'Something went wrong.' })\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n</PagesOnly>\n\n## Session Management\n\nSession management ensures that the user's authenticated state is preserved across requests. It involves creating, storing, refreshing, and deleting sessions or tokens.\n\nThere are two types of sessions:\n\n1. [**Stateless**](#stateless-sessions): Session data (or a token) is stored in the browser's cookies. The cookie is sent with each request, allowing the session to be verified on the server. This method is simpler, but can be less secure if not implemented correctly.\n2. [**Database**](#database-sessions): Session data is stored in a database, with the user's browser only receiving the encrypted session ID. This method is more secure, but can be complex and use more server resources.\n\n> **Good to know:** While you can use either method, or both, we recommend using session management library such as [iron-session](https://github.com/vvo/iron-session) or [Jose](https://github.com/panva/jose).\n\n### Stateless Sessions\n\n<AppOnly>\n\nTo create and manage stateless sessions, there are a few steps you need to follow:\n\n1. Generate a secret key, which will be used to sign your session, and store it as an [environment variable](/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/environment-variables).\n2. Write logic to encrypt/decrypt session data using a session management library.\n3. Manage cookies using the Next.js [`cookies()`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/cookies) API.\n\nIn addition to the above, consider adding functionality to [update (or refresh)](#updating-or-refreshing-sessions) the session when the user returns to the application, and [delete](#deleting-the-session) the session when the user logs out.\n\n> **Good to know:** Check if your [auth library](#auth-libraries) includes session management.\n\n#### 1. Generating a secret key\n\nThere are a few ways you can generate secret key to sign your session. For example, you may choose to use the `openssl` command in your terminal:\n\n```bash filename=\"terminal\"\nopenssl rand -base64 32\n```\n\nThis command generates a 32-character random string that you can use as your secret key and store in your [environment variables file](/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/environment-variables):\n\n```bash filename=\".env\"\nSESSION_SECRET=your_secret_key\n```\n\nYou can then reference this key in your session management logic:\n\n```js filename=\"app/lib/session.js\"\nconst secretKey = process.env.SESSION_SECRET\n```\n\n#### 2. Encrypting and decrypting sessions\n\nNext, you can use your preferred [session management library](#session-management-libraries) to encrypt and decrypt sessions. Continuing from the previous example, we'll use [Jose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jose) (compatible with the [Edge Runtime](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/edge-and-nodejs-runtimes)) and React's [`server-only`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/server-only) package to ensure that your session management logic is only executed on the server.\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/lib/session.ts\" switcher\nimport 'server-only'\nimport { SignJWT, jwtVerify } from 'jose'\nimport { SessionPayload } from '@/app/lib/definitions'\n\nconst secretKey = process.env.SESSION_SECRET\nconst encodedKey = new TextEncoder().encode(secretKey)\n\nexport async function encrypt(payload: SessionPayload) {\n  return new SignJWT(payload)\n    .setProtectedHeader({ alg: 'HS256' })\n    .setIssuedAt()\n    .setExpirationTime('7d')\n    .sign(encodedKey)\n}\n\nexport async function decrypt(session: string | undefined = '') {\n  try {\n    const { payload } = await jwtVerify(session, encodedKey, {\n      algorithms: ['HS256'],\n    })\n    return payload\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.log('Failed to verify session')\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/lib/session.js\" switcher\nimport 'server-only'\nimport { SignJWT, jwtVerify } from 'jose'\n\nconst secretKey = process.env.SESSION_SECRET\nconst encodedKey = new TextEncoder().encode(secretKey)\n\nexport async function encrypt(payload) {\n  return new SignJWT(payload)\n    .setProtectedHeader({ alg: 'HS256' })\n    .setIssuedAt()\n    .setExpirationTime('7d')\n    .sign(encodedKey)\n}\n\nexport async function decrypt(session) {\n  try {\n    const { payload } = await jwtVerify(session, encodedKey, {\n      algorithms: ['HS256'],\n    })\n    return payload\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.log('Failed to verify session')\n  }\n}\n```\n\n> **Tips**:\n>\n> - The payload should contain the **minimum**, unique user data that'll be used in subsequent requests, such as the user's ID, role, etc. It should not contain personally identifiable information like phone number, email address, credit card information, etc, or sensitive data like passwords.\n\n#### 3. Setting cookies (recommended options)\n\nTo store the session in a cookie, use the Next.js [`cookies()`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/cookies) API. The cookie should be set on the server, and include the recommended options:\n\n- **HttpOnly**: Prevents client-side JavaScript from accessing the cookie.\n- **Secure**: Use https to send the cookie.\n- **SameSite**: Specify whether the cookie can be sent with cross-site requests.\n- **Max-Age or Expires**: Delete the cookie after a certain period.\n- **Path**: Define the URL path for the cookie.\n\nPlease refer to [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies) for more information on each of these options.\n\n```ts filename=\"app/lib/session.ts\" switcher\nimport 'server-only'\nimport { cookies } from 'next/headers'\n\nexport async function createSession(userId: string) {\n  const expiresAt = new Date(Date.now() + 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000)\n  const session = await encrypt({ userId, expiresAt })\n\n  cookies().set('session', session, {\n    httpOnly: true,\n    secure: true,\n    expires: expiresAt,\n    sameSite: 'lax',\n    path: '/',\n  })\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"app/lib/session.js\" switcher\nimport 'server-only'\nimport { cookies } from 'next/headers'\n\nexport async function createSession(userId) {\n  const expiresAt = new Date(Date.now() + 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000)\n  const session = await encrypt({ userId, expiresAt })\n\n  cookies().set('session', session, {\n    httpOnly: true,\n    secure: true,\n    expires: expiresAt,\n    sameSite: 'lax',\n    path: '/',\n  })\n}\n```\n\nBack in your Server Action, you can invoke the `createSession()` function, and use the [`redirect()`](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/redirecting) API to redirect the user to the appropriate page:\n\n```ts filename=\"app/actions/auth.ts\" switcher\nimport { createSession } from '@/app/lib/session'\n\nexport async function signup(state: FormState, formData: FormData) {\n  // Previous steps:\n  // 1. Validate form fields\n  // 2. Prepare data for insertion into database\n  // 3. Insert the user into the database or call an Library API\n\n  // Current steps:\n  // 4. Create user session\n  await createSession(user.id)\n  // 5. Redirect user\n  redirect('/profile')\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"app/actions/auth.js\" switcher\nimport { createSession } from '@/app/lib/session'\n\nexport async function signup(state, formData) {\n  // Previous steps:\n  // 1. Validate form fields\n  // 2. Prepare data for insertion into database\n  // 3. Insert the user into the database or call an Library API\n\n  // Current steps:\n  // 4. Create user session\n  await createSession(user.id)\n  // 5. Redirect user\n  redirect('/profile')\n}\n```\n\n> **Tips**:\n>\n> - **Cookies should be set on the server** to prevent client-side tampering.\n> - 🎥 Watch: Learn more about stateless sessions and authentication with Next.js → [YouTube (11 minutes)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJvM2lSPn6w).\n\n#### Updating (or refreshing) sessions\n\nYou can also extend the session's expiration time. This is useful for keeping the user logged in after they access the application again. For example:\n\n```ts filename=\"app/lib/session.ts\" switcher\nimport 'server-only'\nimport { cookies } from 'next/headers'\nimport { decrypt } from '@/app/lib/session'\n\nexport async function updateSession() {\n  const session = cookies().get('session')?.value\n  const payload = await decrypt(session)\n\n  if (!session || !payload) {\n    return null\n  }\n\n  const expires = new Date(Date.now() + 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000)\n  cookies().set('session', session, {\n    httpOnly: true,\n    secure: true,\n    expires: expires,\n    sameSite: 'lax',\n    path: '/',\n  })\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"app/lib/session.js\" switcher\nimport 'server-only'\nimport { cookies } from 'next/headers'\nimport { decrypt } from '@/app/lib/session'\n\nexport async function updateSession() {\n  const session = cookies().get('session').value\n  const payload = await decrypt(session)\n\n  if (!session || !payload) {\n    return null\n  }\n\n  const expires = new Date(Date.now() + 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000)\n  cookies().set('session', session, {\n    httpOnly: true,\n    secure: true,\n    expires: expires,\n    sameSite: 'lax',\n    path: '/',\n  })\n}\n```\n\n> **Tip:** Check if your auth library supports refresh tokens, which can be used to extend the user's session.\n\n#### Deleting the session\n\nTo delete the session, you can delete the cookie:\n\n```ts filename=\"app/lib/session.ts\" switcher\nimport 'server-only'\nimport { cookies } from 'next/headers'\n\nexport function deleteSession() {\n  cookies().delete('session')\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"app/lib/session.js\" switcher\nimport 'server-only'\nimport { cookies } from 'next/headers'\n\nexport function deleteSession() {\n  cookies().delete('session')\n}\n```\n\nThen you can reuse the `deleteSession()` function in your application, for example, on logout:\n\n```ts filename=\"app/actions/auth.ts\" switcher\nimport { cookies } from 'next/headers'\nimport { deleteSession } from '@/app/lib/session'\n\nexport async function logout() {\n  deleteSession()\n  redirect('/login')\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"app/actions/auth.js\" switcher\nimport { cookies } from 'next/headers'\nimport { deleteSession } from '@/app/lib/session'\n\nexport async function logout() {\n  deleteSession()\n  redirect('/login')\n}\n```\n\n</AppOnly>\n\n<PagesOnly>\n\n#### Setting and deleting cookies\n\nYou can use [API Routes](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) to set the session as a cookie on the server:\n\n```ts filename=\"pages/api/login.ts\" switcher\nimport { serialize } from 'cookie'\nimport type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next'\nimport { encrypt } from '@/app/lib/session'\n\nexport default function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {\n  const sessionData = req.body\n  const encryptedSessionData = encrypt(sessionData)\n\n  const cookie = serialize('session', encryptedSessionData, {\n    httpOnly: true,\n    secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production',\n    maxAge: 60 * 60 * 24 * 7, // One week\n    path: '/',\n  })\n  res.setHeader('Set-Cookie', cookie)\n  res.status(200).json({ message: 'Successfully set cookie!' })\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"pages/api/login.js\" switcher\nimport { serialize } from 'cookie'\nimport { encrypt } from '@/app/lib/session'\n\nexport default function handler(req, res) {\n  const sessionData = req.body\n  const encryptedSessionData = encrypt(sessionData)\n\n  const cookie = serialize('session', encryptedSessionData, {\n    httpOnly: true,\n    secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production',\n    maxAge: 60 * 60 * 24 * 7, // One week\n    path: '/',\n  })\n  res.setHeader('Set-Cookie', cookie)\n  res.status(200).json({ message: 'Successfully set cookie!' })\n}\n```\n\n</PagesOnly>\n\n### Database Sessions\n\nTo create and manage database sessions, you'll need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a table in your database to store session and data (or check if your Auth Library handles this).\n2. Implement functionality to insert, update, and delete sessions\n3. Encrypt the session ID before storing it in the user's browser, and ensure the database and cookie stay in sync (this is optional, but recommended for optimistic auth checks in [Middleware](#optimistic-checks-with-middleware-optional)).\n\n<AppOnly>\n\nFor example:\n\n```ts filename=\"app/lib/session.ts\" switcher\nimport cookies from 'next/headers'\nimport { db } from '@/app/lib/db'\nimport { encrypt } from '@/app/lib/session'\n\nexport async function createSession(id: number) {\n  const expiresAt = new Date(Date.now() + 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000)\n\n  // 1. Create a session in the database\n  const data = await db\n    .insert(sessions)\n    .values({\n      userId: id,\n      expiresAt,\n    })\n    // Return the session ID\n    .returning({ id: sessions.id })\n\n  const sessionId = data[0].id\n\n  // 2. Encrypt the session ID\n  const session = await encrypt({ sessionId, expiresAt })\n\n  // 3. Store the session in cookies for optimistic auth checks\n  cookies().set('session', session, {\n    httpOnly: true,\n    secure: true,\n    expires: expiresAt,\n    sameSite: 'lax',\n    path: '/',\n  })\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"app/lib/session.js\" switcher\nimport cookies from 'next/headers'\nimport { db } from '@/app/lib/db'\nimport { encrypt } from '@/app/lib/session'\n\nexport async function createSession(id) {\n  const expiresAt = new Date(Date.now() + 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000)\n\n  // 1. Create a session in the database\n  const data = await db\n    .insert(sessions)\n    .values({\n      userId: id,\n      expiresAt,\n    })\n    // Return the session ID\n    .returning({ id: sessions.id })\n\n  const sessionId = data[0].id\n\n  // 2. Encrypt the session ID\n  const session = await encrypt({ sessionId, expiresAt })\n\n  // 3. Store the session in cookies for optimistic auth checks\n  cookies().set('session', session, {\n    httpOnly: true,\n    secure: true,\n    expires: expiresAt,\n    sameSite: 'lax',\n    path: '/',\n  })\n}\n```\n\n> **Tips**:\n>\n> - For faster data retrieval, consider using a database like [Vercel Redis](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-kv). However, you can also keep the session data in your primary database, and combine data requests to reduce the number of queries.\n> - You may opt to use database sessions for more advanced use cases, such as keeping track of the last time a user logged in, or number of active devices, or give users the ability to log out of all devices.\n\nAfter implementing session management, you'll need to add authorization logic to control what users can access and do within your application. Continue to the [Authorization](#authorization) section to learn more.\n\n</AppOnly>\n\n<PagesOnly>\n\n**Creating a Session on the Server**:\n\n```ts filename=\"pages/api/create-session.ts\" switcher\nimport db from '../../lib/db'\nimport type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next'\n\nexport default async function handler(\n  req: NextApiRequest,\n  res: NextApiResponse\n) {\n  try {\n    const user = req.body\n    const sessionId = generateSessionId()\n    await db.insertSession({\n      sessionId,\n      userId: user.id,\n      createdAt: new Date(),\n    })\n\n    res.status(200).json({ sessionId })\n  } catch (error) {\n    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Internal Server Error' })\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"pages/api/create-session.js\" switcher\nimport db from '../../lib/db'\n\nexport default async function handler(req, res) {\n  try {\n    const user = req.body\n    const sessionId = generateSessionId()\n    await db.insertSession({\n      sessionId,\n      userId: user.id,\n      createdAt: new Date(),\n    })\n\n    res.status(200).json({ sessionId })\n  } catch (error) {\n    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Internal Server Error' })\n  }\n}\n```\n\n</PagesOnly>\n\n## Authorization\n\nOnce a user is authenticated and a session is created, you can implement authorization to control what the user can access and do within your application.\n\nThere are two main types of authorization checks:\n\n1. **Optimistic**: Checks if the user is authorized to access a route or perform an action using the session data stored in the cookie. These checks are useful for quick operations, such as showing/hiding UI elements or redirecting users based on permissions or roles.\n2. **Secure**: Checks if the user is authorized to access a route or perform an action using the session data stored in the database. These checks are more secure and are used for operations that require access to sensitive data or actions.\n\nFor both cases, we recommend:\n\n- Creating a [Data Access Layer](#creating-a-data-access-layer-dal) to centralize your authorization logic\n- Using [Data Transfer Objects (DTO)](#using-data-transfer-objects-dto) to only return the necessary data\n- Optionally use [Middleware](#optimistic-checks-with-middleware-optional) to perform optimistic checks.\n\n### Optimistic checks with Middleware (Optional)\n\nThere are some cases where you may want to use [Middleware](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware) and redirect users based on permissions:\n\n- To perform optimistic checks. Since Middleware runs on every route, it's a good way to centralize redirect logic and pre-filter unauthorized users.\n- To protect static routes that share data between users (e.g. content behind a paywall).\n\nHowever, since Middleware runs on every route, including [prefetched](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/linking-and-navigating#2-prefetching) routes, it's important to only read the session from the cookie (optimistic checks), and avoid database checks to prevent performance issues.\n\nFor example:\n\n```tsx filename=\"middleware.ts\" switcher\nimport { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server'\nimport { decrypt } from '@/app/lib/session'\nimport { cookies } from 'next/headers'\n\n// 1. Specify protected and public routes\nconst protectedRoutes = ['/dashboard']\nconst publicRoutes = ['/login', '/signup', '/']\n\nexport default async function middleware(req: NextRequest) {\n  // 2. Check if the current route is protected or public\n  const path = req.nextUrl.pathname\n  const isProtectedRoute = protectedRoutes.includes(path)\n  const isPublicRoute = publicRoutes.includes(path)\n\n  // 3. Decrypt the session from the cookie\n  const cookie = cookies().get('session')?.value\n  const session = await decrypt(cookie)\n\n  // 5. Redirect to /login if the user is not authenticated\n  if (isProtectedRoute && !session?.userId) {\n    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', req.nextUrl))\n  }\n\n  // 6. Redirect to /dashboard if the user is authenticated\n  if (\n    isPublicRoute &&\n    session?.userId &&\n    !req.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/dashboard')\n  ) {\n    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/dashboard', req.nextUrl))\n  }\n\n  return NextResponse.next()\n}\n\n// Routes Middleware should not run on\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: ['/((?!api|_next/static|_next/image|.*\\\\.png$).*)'],\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"middleware.js\" switcher\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\nimport { decrypt } from '@/app/lib/session'\nimport { cookies } from 'next/headers'\n\n// 1. Specify protected and public routes\nconst protectedRoutes = ['/dashboard']\nconst publicRoutes = ['/login', '/signup', '/']\n\nexport default async function middleware(req) {\n  // 2. Check if the current route is protected or public\n  const path = req.nextUrl.pathname\n  const isProtectedRoute = protectedRoutes.includes(path)\n  const isPublicRoute = publicRoutes.includes(path)\n\n  // 3. Decrypt the session from the cookie\n  const cookie = cookies().get('session')?.value\n  const session = await decrypt(cookie)\n\n  // 5. Redirect to /login if the user is not authenticated\n  if (isProtectedRoute && !session?.userId) {\n    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', req.nextUrl))\n  }\n\n  // 6. Redirect to /dashboard if the user is authenticated\n  if (\n    isPublicRoute &&\n    session?.userId &&\n    !req.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/dashboard')\n  ) {\n    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/dashboard', req.nextUrl))\n  }\n\n  return NextResponse.next()\n}\n\n// Routes Middleware should not run on\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: ['/((?!api|_next/static|_next/image|.*\\\\.png$).*)'],\n}\n```\n\nWhile Middleware can be useful for initial checks, it should not be your only line of defense in protecting your data. The majority of security checks should be performed as close as possible to your data source, see [Data Access Layer](#creating-a-data-access-layer-dal) for more information.\n\n> **Tips**:\n>\n> - In Middleware, you can also read cookies using `req.cookies.get('session).value`.\n> - Middleware uses the [Edge Runtime](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/edge-and-nodejs-runtimes), check if your Auth library and session management library are compatible.\n> - You can use the `matcher` property in the Middleware to specify which routes Middleware should run on. Although, for auth, it's recommended Middleware runs on all routes.\n\n<AppOnly>\n\n### Creating a Data Access Layer (DAL)\n\nWe recommend creating a DAL to centralize your data requests and authorization logic.\n\nThe DAL should include a function that verifies the user's session as they interact with your application. At the very least, the function should check if the session is valid, then redirect or return the user information needed to make further requests.\n\nFor example, create a separate file for your DAL that includes a `verifySession()` function. Then use React's [cache](https://react.dev/reference/react/cache) API to memoize the return value of the function during a React render pass:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/lib/dal.ts\" switcher\nimport 'server-only'\n\nimport { cookies } from 'next/headers'\nimport { decrypt } from '@/app/lib/session'\n\nexport const verifySession = cache(async () => {\n  const cookie = cookies().get('session')?.value\n  const session = await decrypt(cookie)\n\n  if (!session?.userId) {\n    redirect('/login')\n  }\n\n  return { isAuth: true, userId: session.userId }\n})\n```\n\n```js filename=\"app/lib/dal.js\" switcher\nimport 'server-only'\n\nimport { cookies } from 'next/headers'\nimport { decrypt } from '@/app/lib/session'\n\nexport const verifySession = cache(async () => {\n  const cookie = cookies().get('session').value\n  const session = await decrypt(cookie)\n\n  if (!session.userId) {\n    redirect('/login')\n  }\n\n  return { isAuth: true, userId: session.userId }\n})\n```\n\nYou can then invoke the `verifySession()` function in your data requests, Server Actions, Route Handlers:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/lib/dal.ts\" switcher\nexport const getUser = cache(async () => {\n  const session = await verifySession()\n  if (!session) return null\n\n  try {\n    const data = await db.query.users.findMany({\n      where: eq(users.id, session.userId),\n      // Explicitly return the columns you need rather than the whole user object\n      columns: {\n        id: true,\n        name: true,\n        email: true,\n      },\n    })\n\n    const user = data[0]\n\n    return user\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.log('Failed to fetch user')\n    return null\n  }\n})\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/lib/dal.js\" switcher\nexport const getUser = cache(async () => {\n  const session = await verifySession()\n  if (!session) return null\n\n  try {\n    const data = await db.query.users.findMany({\n      where: eq(users.id, session.userId),\n      // Explicitly return the columns you need rather than the whole user object\n      columns: {\n        id: true,\n        name: true,\n        email: true,\n      },\n    })\n\n    const user = data[0]\n\n    return user\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.log('Failed to fetch user')\n    return null\n  }\n})\n```\n\n> **Tip**:\n>\n> - A DAL can be used to protect data fetched at request time. However, for static routes that share data between users, data will be fetched at build time and not at request time. Use [Middleware](#optimistic-checks-with-middleware-optional) to protect static routes.\n> - For secure checks, you can check if the session is valid by comparing the session ID with your database. Use React's [cache](https://react.dev/reference/react/cache) function to avoid unnecessary duplicate requests to the database during a render pass.\n> - You may wish to consolidate related data requests in a JavaScript class that runs `verifySession()` before any methods.\n\n### Using Data Transfer Objects (DTO)\n\nWhen retrieving data, it's recommended you return only the necessary data that will be used in your application, and not entire objects. For example, if you're fetching user data, you might only return the user's ID and name, rather than the entire user object which could contain passwords, phone numbers, etc.\n\nHowever, if you have no control over the returned data structure, or are working in a team where you want to avoid whole objects being passed to the client, you can use strategies such as specifying what fields are safe to be exposed to the client.\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/lib/dto.ts\" switcher\nimport 'server-only'\nimport { getUser } from '@/app/lib/dal'\n\nfunction canSeeUsername(viewer: User) {\n  return true\n}\n\nfunction canSeePhoneNumber(viewer: User, team: string) {\n  return viewer.isAdmin || team === viewer.team\n}\n\nexport async function getProfileDTO(slug: string) {\n  const data = await db.query.users.findMany({\n    where: eq(users.slug, slug),\n    // Return specific columns here\n  })\n  const user = data[0]\n\n  const currentUser = await getUser(user.id)\n\n  // Or return only what's specific to the query here\n  return {\n    username: canSeeUsername(currentUser) ? user.username : null,\n    phonenumber: canSeePhoneNumber(currentUser, user.team)\n      ? user.phonenumber\n      : null,\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"app/lib/dto.js\" switcher\nimport 'server-only'\nimport { getUser } from '@/app/lib/dal'\n\nfunction canSeeUsername(viewer) {\n  return true\n}\n\nfunction canSeePhoneNumber(viewer, team) {\n  return viewer.isAdmin || team === viewer.team\n}\n\nexport async function getProfileDTO(slug) {\n  const data = await db.query.users.findMany({\n    where: eq(users.slug, slug),\n    // Return specific columns here\n  })\n  const user = data[0]\n\n  const currentUser = await getUser(user.id)\n\n  // Or return only what's specific to the query here\n  return {\n    username: canSeeUsername(currentUser) ? user.username : null,\n    phonenumber: canSeePhoneNumber(currentUser, user.team)\n      ? user.phonenumber\n      : null,\n  }\n}\n```\n\nBy centralizing your data requests and authorization logic in a DAL and using DTOs, you can ensure that all data requests are secure and consistent, making it easier to maintain, audit, and debug as your application scales.\n\n> **Good to know**:\n>\n> - There are a couple of different ways you can define a DTO, from using `toJSON()`, to individual functions like the example above, or JS classes. Since these are JavaScript patterns and not a React or Next.js feature, we recommend doing some research to find the best pattern for your application.\n> - Learn more about security best practices in our [Security in Next.js article](/blog/security-nextjs-server-components-actions).\n\n### Server Components\n\nAuth check in [Server Components](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components) are useful for role-based access. For example, to conditionally render components based on the user's role:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/dashboard/page.tsx\" switcher\nimport { verifySession } from '@/app/lib/dal'\n\nexport default function Dashboard() {\n  const session = await verifySession()\n  const userRole = session?.user?.role // Assuming 'role' is part of the session object\n\n  if (userRole === 'admin') {\n    return <AdminDashboard />\n  } else if (userRole === 'user') {\n    return <UserDashboard />\n  } else {\n    redirect('/login')\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/dashboard/page.jsx\" switcher\nimport { verifySession } from '@/app/lib/dal'\n\nexport default function Dashboard() {\n  const session = await verifySession()\n  const userRole = session.role // Assuming 'role' is part of the session object\n\n  if (userRole === 'admin') {\n    return <AdminDashboard />\n  } else if (userRole === 'user') {\n    return <UserDashboard />\n  } else {\n    redirect('/login')\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn the example, we use the `verifySession()` function from our DAL to check for 'admin', 'user', and unauthorized roles. This pattern ensures that each user interacts only with components appropriate to their role.\n\n### Layouts and auth checks\n\nDue to [Partial Rendering](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/linking-and-navigating#4-partial-rendering), be cautious when doing checks in [Layouts](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/layouts-and-templates) as these don't re-render on navigation, meaning the user session won't be checked on every route change.\n\nInstead, you should do the checks close to your data source or the component that'll be conditionally rendered.\n\nFor example, consider a shared layout that fetches the user data and displays the user image in a nav. Instead of doing the auth check in the layout, you should fetch the user data (`getUser()`) in the layout and do the auth check in your DAL.\n\nThis guarantees that wherever `getUser()` is called within your application, the auth check is performed, and prevents developers forgetting to check the user is authorized to access the data.\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/layout.tsx\" switcher\nexport default async function Layout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode;\n}) {\n  const user = await getUser();\n\n  return (\n    // ...\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/layout.js\" switcher\nexport default async function Layout({ children }) {\n  const user = await getUser();\n\n  return (\n    // ...\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```ts filename=\"app/lib/dal.ts\" switcher\nexport const getUser = cache(async () => {\n  const session = await verifySession()\n  if (!session) return null\n\n  // Get user ID from session and fetch data\n})\n```\n\n```js filename=\"app/lib/dal.js\" switcher\nexport const getUser = cache(async () => {\n  const session = await verifySession()\n  if (!session) return null\n\n  // Get user ID from session and fetch data\n})\n```\n\n> **Good to know:**\n>\n> - A common pattern in SPAs is to `return null` in a layout or a top-level component if a user is not authorized. This pattern is not **not recommended** since Next.js applications have multiple entry points, which will not prevent nested route segments and Server Actions from being accessed.\n\n### Server Actions\n\nTreat [Server Actions](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions-and-mutations) with the same security considerations as public-facing API endpoints, and verify if the user is allowed to perform a mutation.\n\nIn the example below, we check the user's role before allowing the action to proceed:\n\n```ts filename=\"app/lib/actions.ts\" switcher\n'use server'\nimport { verifySession } from '@/app/lib/dal'\n\nexport async function serverAction(formData: FormData) {\n  const session = await verifySession()\n  const userRole = session?.user?.role\n\n  // Return early if user is not authorized to perform the action\n  if (userRole !== 'admin') {\n    return null\n  }\n\n  // Proceed with the action for authorized users\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"app/lib/actions.js\" switcher\n'use server'\nimport { verifySession } from '@/app/lib/dal'\n\nexport async function serverAction() {\n  const session = await verifySession()\n  const userRole = session.user.role\n\n  // Return early if user is not authorized to perform the action\n  if (userRole !== 'admin') {\n    return null\n  }\n\n  // Proceed with the action for authorized users\n}\n```\n\n### Route Handlers\n\nTreat [Route Handlers](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-handlers) with the same security considerations as public-facing API endpoints, and verify if the user is allowed to access the Route Handler.\n\nFor example:\n\n```ts filename=\"app/api/route.ts\" switcher\nimport { verifySession } from '@/app/lib/dal'\n\nexport async function GET() {\n  // User authentication and role verification\n  const session = await verifySession()\n\n  // Check if the user is authenticated\n  if (!session) {\n    // User is not authenticated\n    return new Response(null, { status: 401 })\n  }\n\n  // Check if the user has the 'admin' role\n  if (session.user.role !== 'admin') {\n    // User is authenticated but does not have the right permissions\n    return new Response(null, { status: 403 })\n  }\n\n  // Continue for authorized users\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"app/api/route.js\" switcher\nimport { verifySession } from '@/app/lib/dal'\n\nexport async function GET() {\n  // User authentication and role verification\n  const session = await verifySession()\n\n  // Check if the user is authenticated\n  if (!session) {\n    // User is not authenticated\n    return new Response(null, { status: 401 })\n  }\n\n  // Check if the user has the 'admin' role\n  if (session.user.role !== 'admin') {\n    // User is authenticated but does not have the right permissions\n    return new Response(null, { status: 403 })\n  }\n\n  // Continue for authorized users\n}\n```\n\nThe example above demonstrates a Route Handler with a two-tier security check. It first checks for an active session, and then verifies if the logged-in user is an 'admin'.\n\n## Context Providers\n\nUsing context providers for auth work due to [interleaving](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/composition-patterns#interleaving-server-and-client-components). However, React `context` is not supported in Server Components, making them only applicable to Client Components.\n\nThis works, but any child Server Components will be rendered on the server first, and will not have access to the context provider’s session data:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/layout.ts\" switcher\nimport { ContextProvider } from 'auth-lib'\n\nexport default function RootLayout({ children }) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <body>\n        <ContextProvider>{children}</ContextProvider>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/ui/profile.ts switcher\n\"use client\";\n\nimport { useSession } from \"auth-lib\";\n\nexport default function Profile() {\n  const { userId } = useSession();\n  const { data } = useSWR(`/api/user/${userId}`, fetcher)\n\n  return (\n    // ...\n  );\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/ui/profile.js switcher\n\"use client\";\n\nimport { useSession } from \"auth-lib\";\n\nexport default function Profile() {\n  const { userId } = useSession();\n  const { data } = useSWR(`/api/user/${userId}`, fetcher)\n\n  return (\n    // ...\n  );\n}\n```\n\nIf session data is needed in Client Components (e.g. for client-side data fetching),use React’s [`taintUniqueValue`](https://react.dev/reference/react/experimental_taintUniqueValue) API to prevent sensitive session data from being exposed to the client.\n\n</AppOnly>\n\n<PagesOnly>\n\n### Creating a Data Access Layer (DAL)\n\n#### Protecting API Routes\n\nAPI Routes in Next.js are essential for handling server-side logic and data management. It's crucial to secure these routes to ensure that only authorized users can access specific functionalities. This typically involves verifying the user's authentication status and their role-based permissions.\n\nHere's an example of securing an API Route:\n\n```ts filename=\"pages/api/route.ts\" switcher\nimport { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next'\n\nexport default async function handler(\n  req: NextApiRequest,\n  res: NextApiResponse\n) {\n  const session = await getSession(req)\n\n  // Check if the user is authenticated\n  if (!session) {\n    res.status(401).json({\n      error: 'User is not authenticated',\n    })\n    return\n  }\n\n  // Check if the user has the 'admin' role\n  if (session.user.role !== 'admin') {\n    res.status(401).json({\n      error: 'Unauthorized access: User does not have admin privileges.',\n    })\n    return\n  }\n\n  // Proceed with the route for authorized users\n  // ... implementation of the API Route\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"pages/api/route.js\" switcher\nexport default async function handler(req, res) {\n  const session = await getSession(req)\n\n  // Check if the user is authenticated\n  if (!session) {\n    res.status(401).json({\n      error: 'User is not authenticated',\n    })\n    return\n  }\n\n  // Check if the user has the 'admin' role\n  if (session.user.role !== 'admin') {\n    res.status(401).json({\n      error: 'Unauthorized access: User does not have admin privileges.',\n    })\n    return\n  }\n\n  // Proceed with the route for authorized users\n  // ... implementation of the API Route\n}\n```\n\nThis example demonstrates an API Route with a two-tier security check for authentication and authorization. It first checks for an active session, and then verifies if the logged-in user is an 'admin'. This approach ensures secure access, limited to authenticated and authorized users, maintaining robust security for request processing.\n\n</PagesOnly>\n\n## Resources\n\nNow that you've learned about authentication in Next.js, here are Next.js-compatible libraries and resources to help you implement secure authentication and session management:\n\n### Auth Libraries\n\n- [Auth0](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/webapp/nextjs/01-login)\n- [Clerk](https://clerk.com/docs/quickstarts/nextjs)\n- [Kinde](https://kinde.com/docs/developer-tools/nextjs-sdk)\n- [Lucia](https://lucia-auth.com/getting-started/nextjs-app)\n- [NextAuth.js](https://authjs.dev/getting-started/installation?framework=next.js)\n- [Supabase](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/quickstarts/nextjs)\n- [Stytch](https://stytch.com/docs/guides/quickstarts/nextjs)\n- [WorkOS](https://workos.com/docs/user-management)\n\n### Session Management Libraries\n\n- [Iron Session](https://github.com/vvo/iron-session)\n- [Jose](https://github.com/panva/jose)\n\n## Further Reading\n\nTo continue learning about authentication and security, check out the following resources:\n\n- [How to think about security in Next.js](/blog/security-nextjs-server-components-actions)\n- [Understanding XSS Attacks](https://vercel.com/guides/understanding-xss-attacks)\n- [Understanding CSRF Attacks](https://vercel.com/guides/understanding-csrf-attacks)\n- [The Copenhagen Book](https://thecopenhagenbook.com/)\n"},{"path":"docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/06-optimizing/09-instrumentation.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/06-optimizing/09-instrumentation.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/instrumentation","sha":"a6e3257743454e6f38cd8195e1641dee650f0a4d","size":4403,"content":"---\ntitle: Instrumentation\ndescription: Learn how to use instrumentation to run code at server startup in your Next.js app\nrelated:\n  title: Learn more about Instrumentation\n  links:\n    - app/api-reference/file-conventions/instrumentation\n    - app/api-reference/next-config-js/instrumentationHook\n---\n\n{/* The content of this doc is shared between the app and pages router.

Any shared content should not be wrapped in a component. */}\n\nInstrumentation is the process of using code to integrate monitoring and logging tools into your application. This allows you to track the performance and behavior of your application, and to debug issues in production.\n\n## Convention\n\nTo set up instrumentation, create `instrumentation.ts|js` file in the **root directory** of your project (or inside the [`src`](/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/src-directory) folder if using one).\n\nThen, export a `register` function in the file. This function will be called **once** when a new Next.js server instance is initiated.\n\nFor example, to use Next.js with [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) and [@vercel/otel](https://vercel.com/docs/observability/otel-overview):\n\n```ts filename=\"instrumentation.ts\" switcher\nimport { registerOTel } from '@vercel/otel'\n\nexport function register() {\n  registerOTel('next-app')\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"instrumentation.js\" switcher\nimport { registerOTel } from '@vercel/otel'\n\nexport function register() {\n  registerOTel('next-app')\n}\n```\n\nSee the [Next.js with OpenTelemetry example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-opentelemetry) for a complete implementation.\n\n> **Good to know**\n>\n> - This feature is **experimental**. To use it, you must explicitly opt in by defining [`experimental.instrumentationHook = true;`](/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/instrumentationHook) in your `next.config.js`.\n> - The `instrumentation` file should be in the root of your project and not inside the `app` or `pages` directory. If you're using the `src` folder, then place the file inside `src` alongside `pages` and `app`.\n> - If you use the [`pageExtensions` config option](/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/pageExtensions) to add a suffix, you will also need to update the `instrumentation` filename to match.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Importing files with side effects\n\nSometimes, it may be useful to import a file in your code because of the side effects it will cause. For example, you might import a file that defines a set of global variables, but never explicitly use the imported file in your code. You would still have access to the global variables the package has declared.\n\nWe recommend importing files using JavaScript `import` syntax within your `register` function. The following example demonstrates a basic usage of `import` in a `register` function:\n\n```ts filename=\"instrumentation.ts\" switcher\nexport async function register() {\n  await import('package-with-side-effect')\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"instrumentation.js\" switcher\nexport async function register() {\n  await import('package-with-side-effect')\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know:**\n>\n> We recommend importing the file from within the `register` function, rather than at the top of the file. By doing this, you can colocate all of your side effects in one place in your code, and avoid any unintended consequences from importing globally at the top of the file.\n\n### Importing runtime-specific code\n\nNext.js calls `register` in all environments, so it's important to conditionally import any code that doesn't support specific runtimes (e.g. [Edge or Node.js](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/edge-and-nodejs-runtimes)). You can use the `NEXT_RUNTIME` environment variable to get the current environment:\n\n```ts filename=\"instrumentation.ts\" switcher\nexport async function register() {\n  if (process.env.NEXT_RUNTIME === 'nodejs') {\n    await import('./instrumentation-node')\n  }\n\n  if (process.env.NEXT_RUNTIME === 'edge') {\n    await import('./instrumentation-edge')\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"instrumentation.js\" switcher\nexport async function register() {\n  if (process.env.NEXT_RUNTIME === 'nodejs') {\n    await import('./instrumentation-node')\n  }\n\n  if (process.env.NEXT_RUNTIME === 'edge') {\n    await import('./instrumentation-edge')\n  }\n}\n```\n"},{"path":"docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/06-optimizing/10-open-telemetry.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/06-optimizing/10-open-telemetry.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/open-telemetry","sha":"42efc9f2b6a212f8c3669c4c0615dbebdc5cdd2c","size":14101,"content":"---\ntitle: OpenTelemetry\ndescription: Learn how to instrument your Next.js app with OpenTelemetry.\n---\n\n{/* The content of this doc is shared between the app and pages router. You can use the `<PagesOnly>Content</PagesOnly>` component to add content that is specific to the Pages Router. Any shared content should not be wrapped in a component. */}\n\n> **Good to know**: This feature is **experimental**, you need to explicitly opt-in by providing `experimental.instrumentationHook = true;` in your `next.config.js`.\n\nObservability is crucial for understanding and optimizing the behavior and performance of your Next.js app.\n\nAs applications become more complex, it becomes increasingly difficult to identify and diagnose issues that may arise. By leveraging observability tools, such as logging and metrics, developers can gain insights into their application's behavior and identify areas for optimization. With observability, developers can proactively address issues before they become major problems and provide a better user experience. Therefore, it is highly recommended to use observability in your Next.js applications to improve performance, optimize resources, and enhance user experience.\n\nWe recommend using OpenTelemetry for instrumenting your apps.\nIt's a platform-agnostic way to instrument apps that allows you to change your observability provider without changing your code.\nRead [Official OpenTelemetry docs](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/) for more information about OpenTelemetry and how it works.\n\nThis documentation uses terms like _Span_, _Trace_ or _Exporter_ throughout this doc, all of which can be found in [the OpenTelemetry Observability Primer](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/observability-primer/).\n\nNext.js supports OpenTelemetry instrumentation out of the box, which means that we already instrumented Next.js itself.\nWhen you enable OpenTelemetry we will automatically wrap all your code like `getStaticProps` in _spans_ with helpful attributes.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nOpenTelemetry is extensible but setting it up properly can be quite verbose.\nThat's why we prepared a package `@vercel/otel` that helps you get started quickly.\n\n### Using `@vercel/otel`\n\nTo get started, you must install `@vercel/otel`:\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nnpm install @vercel/otel\n```\n\n<AppOnly>\n\nNext, create a custom [`instrumentation.ts`](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/instrumentation) (or `.js`) file in the **root directory** of the project (or inside `src` folder if using one):\n\n</AppOnly>\n\n<PagesOnly>\n\nNext, create a custom [`instrumentation.ts`](/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/instrumentation) (or `.js`) file in the **root directory** of the project (or inside `src` folder if using one):\n\n</PagesOnly>\n\n```ts filename=\"your-project/instrumentation.ts\" switcher\nimport { registerOTel } from '@vercel/otel'\n\nexport function register() {\n  registerOTel({ serviceName: 'next-app' })\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"your-project/instrumentation.js\" switcher\nimport { registerOTel } from '@vercel/otel'\n\nexport function register() {\n  registerOTel({ serviceName: 'next-app' })\n}\n```\n\nSee the [`@vercel/otel` documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vercel/otel) for additional configuration options.\n\n<AppOnly>\n\n> **Good to know**\n>\n> - The `instrumentation` file should be in the root of your project and not inside the `app` or `pages` directory. If you're using the `src` folder, then place the file inside `src` alongside `pages` and `app`.\n> - If you use the [`pageExtensions` config option](/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/pageExtensions) to add a suffix, you will also need to update the `instrumentation` filename to match.\n> - We have created a basic [with-opentelemetry](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-opentelemetry) example that you can use.\n\n</AppOnly>\n\n<PagesOnly>\n\n> **Good to know**\n>\n> - The `instrumentation` file should be in the root of your project and not inside the `app` or `pages` directory. If you're using the `src` folder, then place the file inside `src` alongside `pages` and `app`.\n> - If you use the [`pageExtensions` config option](/docs/pages/api-reference/next-config-js/pageExtensions) to add a suffix, you will also need to update the `instrumentation` filename to match.\n> - We have created a basic [with-opentelemetry](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-opentelemetry) example that you can use.\n\n</PagesOnly>\n\n### Manual OpenTelemetry configuration\n\nThe `@vercel/otel` package provides many configuration options and should serve most of common use cases. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can configure OpenTelemetry manually.\n\nFirstly you need to install OpenTelemetry packages:\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nnpm install @opentelemetry/sdk-node @opentelemetry/resources @opentelemetry/semantic-conventions @opentelemetry/sdk-trace-node @opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-http\n```\n\nNow you can initialize `NodeSDK` in your `instrumentation.ts`.\nUnlike `@vercel/otel`, `NodeSDK` is not compatible with edge runtime, so you need to make sure that you are importing them only when `process.env.NEXT_RUNTIME === 'nodejs'`. We recommend creating a new file `instrumentation.node.ts` which you conditionally import only when using node:\n\n```ts filename=\"instrumentation.ts\" switcher\nexport async function register() {\n  if (process.env.NEXT_RUNTIME === 'nodejs') {\n    await import('./instrumentation.node.ts')\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"instrumentation.js\" switcher\nexport async function register() {\n  if (process.env.NEXT_RUNTIME === 'nodejs') {\n    await import('./instrumentation.node.js')\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```ts filename=\"instrumentation.node.ts\" switcher\nimport { NodeSDK } from '@opentelemetry/sdk-node'\nimport { OTLPTraceExporter } from '@opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-http'\nimport { Resource } from '@opentelemetry/resources'\nimport { SEMRESATTRS_SERVICE_NAME } from '@opentelemetry/semantic-conventions'\nimport { SimpleSpanProcessor } from '@opentelemetry/sdk-trace-node'\n\nconst sdk = new NodeSDK({\n  resource: new Resource({\n    [SEMRESATTRS_SERVICE_NAME]: 'next-app',\n  }),\n  spanProcessor: new SimpleSpanProcessor(new OTLPTraceExporter()),\n})\nsdk.start()\n```\n\n```js filename=\"instrumentation.node.js\" switcher\nimport { NodeSDK } from '@opentelemetry/sdk-node'\nimport { OTLPTraceExporter } from '@opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-http'\nimport { Resource } from '@opentelemetry/resources'\nimport { SEMRESATTRS_SERVICE_NAME } from '@opentelemetry/semantic-conventions'\nimport { SimpleSpanProcessor } from '@opentelemetry/sdk-trace-node'\n\nconst sdk = new NodeSDK({\n  resource: new Resource({\n    [SEMRESATTRS_SERVICE_NAME]: 'next-app',\n  }),\n  spanProcessor: new SimpleSpanProcessor(new OTLPTraceExporter()),\n})\nsdk.start()\n```\n\nDoing this is equivalent to using `@vercel/otel`, but it's possible to modify and extend some features that are not exposed by the `@vercel/otel`. If edge runtime support is necessary, you will have to use `@vercel/otel`.\n\n## Testing your instrumentation\n\nYou need an OpenTelemetry collector with a compatible backend to test OpenTelemetry traces locally.\nWe recommend using our [OpenTelemetry dev environment](https://github.com/vercel/opentelemetry-collector-dev-setup).\n\nIf everything works well you should be able to see the root server span labeled as `GET /requested/pathname`.\nAll other spans from that particular trace will be nested under it.\n\nNext.js traces more spans than are emitted by default.\nTo see more spans, you must set `NEXT_OTEL_VERBOSE=1`.\n\n## Deployment\n\n### Using OpenTelemetry Collector\n\nWhen you are deploying with OpenTelemetry Collector, you can use `@vercel/otel`.\nIt will work both on Vercel and when self-hosted.\n\n#### Deploying on Vercel\n\nWe made sure that OpenTelemetry works out of the box on Vercel.\n\nFollow [Vercel documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/observability/otel-overview/quickstart) to connect your project to an observability provider.\n\n#### Self-hosting\n\nDeploying to other platforms is also straightforward. You will need to spin up your own OpenTelemetry Collector to receive and process the telemetry data from your Next.js app.\n\nTo do this, follow the [OpenTelemetry Collector Getting Started guide](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/getting-started/), which will walk you through setting up the collector and configuring it to receive data from your Next.js app.\n\nOnce you have your collector up and running, you can deploy your Next.js app to your chosen platform following their respective deployment guides.\n\n### Custom Exporters\n\nOpenTelemetry Collector is not necessary. You can use a custom OpenTelemetry exporter with [`@vercel/otel`](#using-vercelotel) or [manual OpenTelemetry configuration](#manual-opentelemetry-configuration).\n\n## Custom Spans\n\nYou can add a custom span with [OpenTelemetry APIs](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/js/instrumentation).\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nnpm install @opentelemetry/api\n```\n\nThe following example demonstrates a function that fetches GitHub stars and adds a custom `fetchGithubStars` span to track the fetch request's result:\n\n```ts\nimport { trace } from '@opentelemetry/api'\n\nexport async function fetchGithubStars() {\n  return await trace\n    .getTracer('nextjs-example')\n    .startActiveSpan('fetchGithubStars', async (span) => {\n      try {\n        return await getValue()\n      } finally {\n        span.end()\n      }\n    })\n}\n```\n\nThe `register` function will execute before your code runs in a new environment.\nYou can start creating new spans, and they should be correctly added to the exported trace.\n\n## Default Spans in Next.js\n\nNext.js automatically instruments several spans for you to provide useful insights into your application's performance.\n\nAttributes on spans follow [OpenTelemetry semantic conventions](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/reference/specification/trace/semantic_conventions/). We also add some custom attributes under the `next` namespace:\n\n- `next.span_name` - duplicates span name\n- `next.span_type` - each span type has a unique identifier\n- `next.route` - The route pattern of the request (e.g., `/[param]/user`).\n- `next.rsc` (true/false) - Whether the request is an RSC request, such as prefetch.\n- `next.page`\n  - This is an internal value used by an app router.\n  - You can think about it as a route to a special file (like `page.ts`, `layout.ts`, `loading.ts` and others)\n  - It can be used as a unique identifier only when paired with `next.route` because `/layout` can be used to identify both `/(groupA)/layout.ts` and `/(groupB)/layout.ts`\n\n### `[http.method] [next.route]`\n\n- `next.span_type`: `BaseServer.handleRequest`\n\nThis span represents the root span for each incoming request to your Next.js application. It tracks the HTTP method, route, target, and status code of the request.\n\nAttributes:\n\n- [Common HTTP attributes](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/reference/specification/trace/semantic_conventions/http/#common-attributes)\n  - `http.method`\n  - `http.status_code`\n- [Server HTTP attributes](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/reference/specification/trace/semantic_conventions/http/#http-server-semantic-conventions)\n  - `http.route`\n  - `http.target`\n- `next.span_name`\n- `next.span_type`\n- `next.route`\n\n### `render route (app) [next.route]`\n\n- `next.span_type`: `AppRender.getBodyResult`.\n\nThis span represents the process of rendering a route in the app router.\n\nAttributes:\n\n- `next.span_name`\n- `next.span_type`\n- `next.route`\n\n### `fetch [http.method] [http.url]`\n\n- `next.span_type`: `AppRender.fetch`\n\nThis span represents the fetch request executed in your code.\n\nAttributes:\n\n- [Common HTTP attributes](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/reference/specification/trace/semantic_conventions/http/#common-attributes)\n  - `http.method`\n- [Client HTTP attributes](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/reference/specification/trace/semantic_conventions/http/#http-client)\n  - `http.url`\n  - `net.peer.name`\n  - `net.peer.port` (only if specified)\n- `next.span_name`\n- `next.span_type`\n\nThis span can be turned off by setting `NEXT_OTEL_FETCH_DISABLED=1` in your environment. This is useful when you want to use a custom fetch instrumentation library.\n\n### `executing api route (app) [next.route]`\n\n- `next.span_type`: `AppRouteRouteHandlers.runHandler`.\n\nThis span represents the execution of an API route handler in the app router.\n\nAttributes:\n\n- `next.span_name`\n- `next.span_type`\n- `next.route`\n\n### `getServerSideProps [next.route]`\n\n- `next.span_type`: `Render.getServerSideProps`.\n\nThis span represents the execution of `getServerSideProps` for a specific route.\n\nAttributes:\n\n- `next.span_name`\n- `next.span_type`\n- `next.route`\n\n### `getStaticProps [next.route]`\n\n- `next.span_type`: `Render.getStaticProps`.\n\nThis span represents the execution of `getStaticProps` for a specific route.\n\nAttributes:\n\n- `next.span_name`\n- `next.span_type`\n- `next.route`\n\n### `render route (pages) [next.route]`\n\n- `next.span_type`: `Render.renderDocument`.\n\nThis span represents the process of rendering the document for a specific route.\n\nAttributes:\n\n- `next.span_name`\n- `next.span_type`\n- `next.route`\n\n### `generateMetadata [next.page]`\n\n- `next.span_type`: `ResolveMetadata.generateMetadata`.\n\nThis span represents the process of generating metadata for a specific page (a single route can have multiple of these spans).\n\nAttributes:\n\n- `next.span_name`\n- `next.span_type`\n- `next.page`\n\n### `resolve page components`\n\n- `next.span_type`: `NextNodeServer.findPageComponents`.\n\nThis span represents the process of resolving page components for a specific page.\n\nAttributes:\n\n- `next.span_name`\n- `next.span_type`\n- `next.route`\n\n### `resolve segment modules`\n\n- `next.span_type`: `NextNodeServer.getLayoutOrPageModule`.\n\nThis span represents loading of code modules for a layout or a page.\n\nAttributes:\n\n- `next.span_name`\n- `next.span_type`\n- `next.segment`\n\n### `start response`\n\n- `next.span_type`: `NextNodeServer.startResponse`.\n\nThis zero-length span represents the time when the first byte has been sent in the response.\n"},{"path":"docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/06-optimizing/05-scripts.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/06-optimizing/05-scripts.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/scripts","sha":"33833129a2f3bd11a3f160f45f8d6d9200e0c39f","size":10243,"content":"---\ntitle: Script Optimization\nnav_title: Scripts\ndescription: Optimize 3rd party scripts with the built-in Script component.\nrelated:\n  title: API Reference\n  description: Learn more about the next/script API.\n  links:\n    - app/api-reference/components/script\n---\n\n{/* The content of this doc is shared between the app and pages router. You can use the `<PagesOnly>Content</PagesOnly>` component to add content that is specific to the Pages Router. Any shared content should not be wrapped in a component. */}\n\n<AppOnly>\n\n### Layout Scripts\n\nTo load a third-party script for multiple routes, import `next/script` and include the script directly in your layout component:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/dashboard/layout.tsx\" switcher\nimport Script from 'next/script'\n\nexport default function DashboardLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <section>{children}</section>\n      <Script src=\"https://example.com/script.js\" />\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/dashboard/layout.js\" switcher\nimport Script from 'next/script'\n\nexport default function DashboardLayout({ children }) {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <section>{children}</section>\n      <Script src=\"https://example.com/script.js\" />\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nThe third-party script is fetched when the folder route (e.g. `dashboard/page.js`) or any nested route (e.g. `dashboard/settings/page.js`) is accessed by the user. Next.js will ensure the script will **only load once**, even if a user navigates between multiple routes in the same layout.\n\n</AppOnly>\n\n### Application Scripts\n\n<AppOnly>\n\nTo load a third-party script for all routes, import `next/script` and include the script directly in your root layout:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/layout.tsx\" switcher\nimport Script from 'next/script'\n\nexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <body>{children}</body>\n      <Script src=\"https://example.com/script.js\" />\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/layout.js\" switcher\nimport Script from 'next/script'\n\nexport default function RootLayout({ children }) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <body>{children}</body>\n      <Script src=\"https://example.com/script.js\" />\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n</AppOnly>\n\n<PagesOnly>\n\nTo load a third-party script for all routes, import `next/script` and include the script directly in your custom `_app`:\n\n```jsx filename=\"pages/_app.js\"\nimport Script from 'next/script'\n\nexport default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Component {...pageProps} />\n      <Script src=\"https://example.com/script.js\" />\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n</PagesOnly>\n\nThis script will load and execute when _any_ route in your application is accessed. Next.js will ensure the script will **only load once**, even if a user navigates between multiple pages.\n\n> **Recommendation**: We recommend only including third-party scripts in specific pages or layouts in order to minimize any unnecessary impact to performance.\n\n### Strategy\n\nAlthough the default behavior of `next/script` allows you to load third-party scripts in any page or layout, you can fine-tune its loading behavior by using the `strategy` property:\n\n- `beforeInteractive`: Load the script before any Next.js code and before any page hydration occurs.\n- `afterInteractive`: (**default**) Load the script early but after some hydration on the page occurs.\n- `lazyOnload`: Load the script later during browser idle time.\n- `worker`: (experimental) Load the script in a web worker.\n\nRefer to the [`next/script`](/docs/app/api-reference/components/script#strategy) API reference documentation to learn more about each strategy and their use cases.\n\n### Offloading Scripts To A Web Worker (Experimental)\n\n> **Warning:** The `worker` strategy is not yet stable and does not yet work with the [`app`](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/defining-routes) directory. Use with caution.\n\nScripts that use the `worker` strategy are offloaded and executed in a web worker with [Partytown](https://partytown.builder.io/). This can improve the performance of your site by dedicating the main thread to the rest of your application code.\n\nThis strategy is still experimental and can only be used if the `nextScriptWorkers` flag is enabled in `next.config.js`:\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  experimental: {\n    nextScriptWorkers: true,\n  },\n}\n```\n\nThen, run `next` (normally `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`) and Next.js will guide you through the installation of the required packages to finish the setup:\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nnpm run dev\n```\n\nYou'll see instructions like these: Please install Partytown by running `npm install @builder.io/partytown`\n\nOnce setup is complete, defining `strategy=\"worker\"` will automatically instantiate Partytown in your application and offload the script to a web worker.\n\n```tsx filename=\"pages/home.tsx\" switcher\nimport Script from 'next/script'\n\nexport default function Home() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Script src=\"https://example.com/script.js\" strategy=\"worker\" />\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"pages/home.js\" switcher\nimport Script from 'next/script'\n\nexport default function Home() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Script src=\"https://example.com/script.js\" strategy=\"worker\" />\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nThere are a number of trade-offs that need to be considered when loading a third-party script in a web worker. Please see Partytown's [tradeoffs](https://partytown.builder.io/trade-offs) documentation for more information.\n\n### Inline Scripts\n\nInline scripts, or scripts not loaded from an external file, are also supported by the Script component. They can be written by placing the JavaScript within curly braces:\n\n```jsx\n<Script id=\"show-banner\">\n  {`document.getElementById('banner').classList.remove('hidden')`}\n</Script>\n```\n\nOr by using the `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` property:\n\n```jsx\n<Script\n  id=\"show-banner\"\n  dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{\n    __html: `document.getElementById('banner').classList.remove('hidden')`,\n  }}\n/>\n```\n\n> **Warning**: An `id` property must be assigned for inline scripts in order for Next.js to track and optimize the script.\n\n### Executing Additional Code\n\nEvent handlers can be used with the Script component to execute additional code after a certain event occurs:\n\n- `onLoad`: Execute code after the script has finished loading.\n- `onReady`: Execute code after the script has finished loading and every time the component is mounted.\n- `onError`: Execute code if the script fails to load.\n\n<AppOnly>\n\nThese handlers will only work when `next/script` is imported and used inside of a [Client Component](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/client-components) where `\"use client\"` is defined as the first line of code:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/page.tsx\" switcher\n'use client'\n\nimport Script from 'next/script'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Script\n        src=\"https://example.com/script.js\"\n        onLoad={() => {\n          console.log('Script has loaded')\n        }}\n      />\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/page.js\" switcher\n'use client'\n\nimport Script from 'next/script'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Script\n        src=\"https://example.com/script.js\"\n        onLoad={() => {\n          console.log('Script has loaded')\n        }}\n      />\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nRefer to the [`next/script`](/docs/app/api-reference/components/script#onload) API reference to learn more about each event handler and view examples.\n\n</AppOnly>\n\n<PagesOnly>\n\nThese handlers will only work when `next/script` is imported and used inside of a [Client Component](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/client-components) where `\"use client\"` is defined as the first line of code:\n\n```tsx filename=\"pages/index.tsx\" switcher\nimport Script from 'next/script'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Script\n        src=\"https://example.com/script.js\"\n        onLoad={() => {\n          console.log('Script has loaded')\n        }}\n      />\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"pages/index.js\" switcher\nimport Script from 'next/script'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Script\n        src=\"https://example.com/script.js\"\n        onLoad={() => {\n          console.log('Script has loaded')\n        }}\n      />\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nRefer to the [`next/script`](/docs/pages/api-reference/components/script#onload) API reference to learn more about each event handler and view examples.\n\n</PagesOnly>\n\n### Additional Attributes\n\nThere are many DOM attributes that can be assigned to a `<script>` element that are not used by the Script component, like [`nonce`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/nonce) or [custom data attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/data-*). Including any additional attributes will automatically forward it to the final, optimized `<script>` element that is included in the HTML.\n\n<AppOnly>\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/page.tsx\" switcher\nimport Script from 'next/script'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Script\n        src=\"https://example.com/script.js\"\n        id=\"example-script\"\n        nonce=\"XUENAJFW\"\n        data-test=\"script\"\n      />\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/page.js\" switcher\nimport Script from 'next/script'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Script\n        src=\"https://example.com/script.js\"\n        id=\"example-script\"\n        nonce=\"XUENAJFW\"\n        data-test=\"script\"\n      />\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n</AppOnly>\n\n<PagesOnly>\n\n```tsx filename=\"pages/index.tsx\" switcher\nimport Script from 'next/script'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Script\n        src=\"https://example.com/script.js\"\n        id=\"example-script\"\n        nonce=\"XUENAJFW\"\n        data-test=\"script\"\n      />\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"pages/index.js\" switcher\nimport Script from 'next/script'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Script\n        src=\"https://example.com/script.js\"\n        id=\"example-script\"\n        nonce=\"XUENAJFW\"\n        data-test=\"script\"\n      />\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n</PagesOnly>\n"},{"path":"docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/06-optimizing/06-package-bundling.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/06-optimizing/06-package-bundling.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/package-bundling","sha":"ff23b4bbae5fe88e15705954d50881d1018c421b","size":5588,"content":"---\ntitle: Optimizing Package Bundling\nnav_title: Package Bundling\ndescription: Learn how to optimize your application's server and client bundles.\nrelated:\n  description: Learn more about optimizing your application for production.\n  links:\n    - app/building-your-application/deploying/production-checklist\n---\n\nBundling external packages can significantly improve the performance of your application. <AppOnly>By default, packages imported inside Server Components and Route Handlers are automatically bundled by Next.js.

It generates a visual report of the size of each package and their dependencies. You can use the information to remove large dependencies, split, or [lazy-load](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/lazy-loading) your code.\n\n### Installation\n\nInstall the plugin by running the following command:\n\n```bash\nnpm i @next/bundle-analyzer\n# or\nyarn add @next/bundle-analyzer\n# or\npnpm add @next/bundle-analyzer\n```\n\nThen, add the bundle analyzer's settings to your `next.config.js`.\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\n/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */\nconst nextConfig = {}\n\nconst withBundleAnalyzer = require('@next/bundle-analyzer')({\n  enabled: process.env.ANALYZE === 'true',\n})\n\nmodule.exports = withBundleAnalyzer(nextConfig)\n```\n\n### Generating a report\n\nRun the following command to analyze your bundles:\n\n```bash\nANALYZE=true npm run build\n# or\nANALYZE=true yarn build\n# or\nANALYZE=true pnpm build\n```\n\nThe report will open three new tabs in your browser, which you can inspect. Periodically evaluating your application's bundles can help you maintain application performance over time.\n\n## Optimizing package imports\n\nSome packages, such as icon libraries, can export hundreds of modules, which can cause performance issues in development and production.\n\nYou can optimize how these packages are imported by adding the [`optimizePackageImports`](/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/optimizePackageImports) option to your `next.config.js`. This option will only load the modules you _actually_ use, while still giving you the convenience of writing import statements with many named exports.\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\n/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */\nconst nextConfig = {\n  experimental: {\n    optimizePackageImports: ['icon-library'],\n  },\n}\n\nmodule.exports = nextConfig\n```\n\nNext.js also optimizes some libraries automatically, thus they do not need to be included in the optimizePackageImports list. See the [full list](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/optimizePackageImports).\n\n<PagesOnly>\n\n## Bundling specific packages\n\nTo bundle specific packages, you can use the [`transpilePackages`](/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/transpilePackages) option in your `next.config.js`. This option is useful for bundling external packages that are not pre-bundled, for example, in a monorepo or imported from `node_modules`.\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\n/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */\nconst nextConfig = {\n  transpilePackages: ['package-name'],\n}\n\nmodule.exports = nextConfig\n```\n\n## Bundling all packages\n\nTo automatically bundle all packages (default behavior in the App Router), you can use the [`bundlePagesRouterDependencies`](/docs/pages/api-reference/next-config-js/bundlePagesRouterDependencies) option in your `next.config.js`.\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\n/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */\nconst nextConfig = {\n  bundlePagesRouterDependencies: true,\n}\n\nmodule.exports = nextConfig\n```\n\n## Opting specific packages out of bundling\n\nIf you have the [`bundlePagesRouterDependencies`](/docs/pages/api-reference/next-config-js/bundlePagesRouterDependencies) option enabled, you can opt specific packages out of automatic bundling using the [`serverExternalPackages`](/docs/pages/api-reference/next-config-js/serverExternalPackages) option in your `next.config.js`:\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\n/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */\nconst nextConfig = {\n  // Automatically bundle external packages in the Pages Router:\n  bundlePagesRouterDependencies: true,\n  // Opt specific packages out of bundling for both App and Pages Router:\n  serverExternalPackages: ['package-name'],\n}\n\nmodule.exports = nextConfig\n```\n\n</PagesOnly>\n\n<AppOnly>\n\n## Opting specific packages out of bundling\n\nSince packages imported inside Server Components and Route Handlers are automatically bundled by Next.js, you can opt specific packages out of bundling using the [`serverExternalPackages`](/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/serverExternalPackages) option in your `next.config.js`.\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\n/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */\nconst nextConfig = {\n  serverExternalPackages: ['package-name'],\n}\n\nmodule.exports = nextConfig\n```\n\nNext.js includes a list of popular packages that currently are working on compatibility and automatically opt-ed out.

Values: `none`, `metadata`, `auto`.                                 | `<video preload=\"none\" />`           |\n| `playsInline` | Enables inline playback on iOS devices, often necessary for autoplay to work on iOS Safari.               | `<video playsInline />`              |\n\n> **Good to know**: When using the `autoPlay` attribute, it is important to also include the `muted` attribute to ensure the video plays automatically in most browsers and the `playsInline` attribute for compatibility with iOS devices.\n\nFor a comprehensive list of video attributes, refer to the [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video#attributes).\n\n### Video best practices\n\n- **Fallback Content:** When using the `<video>` tag, include fallback content inside the tag for browsers that do not support video playback.\n- **Subtitles or Captions:** Include subtitles or captions for users who are deaf or hard of hearing. Utilize the [`<track>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/track) tag with your `<video>` elements to specify caption file sources.\n- **Accessible Controls:** Standard HTML5 video controls are recommended for keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility. For advanced needs, consider third-party players like [react-player](https://github.com/cookpete/react-player) or [video.js](https://videojs.com/), which offer accessible controls and consistent browser experience.\n\n### `<iframe>`\n\nThe HTML `<iframe>` tag allows you to embed videos from external platforms like YouTube or Vimeo.\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/page.jsx\"\nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <iframe\n      src=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfU1iZnjRZM\"\n      frameborder=\"0\"\n      allowfullscreen\n    />\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### Common `<iframe>` tag attributes\n\n| Attribute         | Description                                                            | Example Value                          |\n| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |\n| `src`             | The URL of the page to embed.                                          | `<iframe src=\"https://example.com\" />` |\n| `width`           | Sets the width of the iframe.                                          | `<iframe width=\"500\" />`               |\n| `height`          | Sets the height of the iframe.                                         | `<iframe height=\"300\" />`              |\n| `frameborder`     | Specifies whether or not to display a border around the iframe.        | `<iframe frameborder=\"0\" />`           |\n| `allowfullscreen` | Allows the iframe content to be displayed in full-screen mode.         | `<iframe allowfullscreen />`           |\n| `sandbox`         | Enables an extra set of restrictions on the content within the iframe. | `<iframe sandbox />`                   |\n| `loading`         | Optimize loading behavior (e.g., lazy loading).                        | `<iframe loading=\"lazy\" />`            |\n| `title`           | Provides a title for the iframe to support accessibility.              | `<iframe title=\"Description\" />`       |\n\nFor a comprehensive list of iframe attributes, refer to the [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe#attributes).\n\n### Choosing a video embedding method\n\nThere are two ways you can embed videos in your Next.js application:\n\n- **Self-hosted or direct video files:** Embed self-hosted videos using the `<video>` tag for scenarios requiring detailed control over the player's functionality and appearance. This integration method within Next.js allows for customization and control of your video content.\n- **Using video hosting services (YouTube, Vimeo, etc.):** For video hosting services like YouTube or Vimeo, you'll embed their iframe-based players using the `<iframe>` tag. While this method limits some control over the player, it offers ease of use and features provided by these platforms.\n\nChoose the embedding method that aligns with your application's requirements and the user experience you aim to deliver.\n\n### Embedding externally hosted videos\n\nTo embed videos from external platforms, you can use Next.js to fetch the video information and React Suspense to handle the fallback state while loading.\n\n**1. Create a Server Component for video embedding**\n\nThe first step is to create a [Server Component](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components) that generates the appropriate iframe for embedding the video. This component will fetch the source URL for the video and render the iframe.\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/ui/video-component.jsx\"\nexport default async function VideoComponent() {\n  const src = await getVideoSrc()\n\n  return <iframe src={src} frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen />\n}\n```\n\n**2. Stream the video component using React Suspense**\n\nAfter creating the Server Component to embed the video, the next step is to [stream](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/loading-ui-and-streaming) the component using [React Suspense](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense).\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/page.jsx\"\nimport { Suspense } from 'react'\nimport VideoComponent from '../ui/VideoComponent.jsx'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <section>\n      <Suspense fallback={<p>Loading video...</p>}>\n        <VideoComponent />\n      </Suspense>\n      {/* Other content of the page */}\n    </section>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know**: When embedding videos from external platforms, consider the following best practices:\n>\n> - Ensure the video embeds are responsive. Use CSS to make the iframe or video player adapt to different screen sizes.\n> - Implement [strategies for loading videos](https://yoast.com/site-speed-tips-for-faster-video/) based on network conditions, especially for users with limited data plans.\n\nThis approach results in a better user experience as it prevents the page from blocking, meaning the user can interact with the page while the video component streams in.\n\nFor a more engaging and informative loading experience, consider using a loading skeleton as the fallback UI. So instead of showing a simple loading message, you can show a skeleton that resembles the video player like this:\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/page.jsx\"\nimport { Suspense } from 'react'\nimport VideoComponent from '../ui/VideoComponent.jsx'\nimport VideoSkeleton from '../ui/VideoSkeleton.jsx'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <section>\n      <Suspense fallback={<VideoSkeleton />}>\n        <VideoComponent />\n      </Suspense>\n      {/* Other content of the page */}\n    </section>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n## Self-hosted videos\n\nSelf-hosting videos may be preferable for several reasons:\n\n- **Complete control and independence**: Self-hosting gives you direct management over your video content, from playback to appearance, ensuring full ownership and control, free from external platform constraints.\n- **Customization for specific needs**: Ideal for unique requirements, like dynamic background videos, it allows for tailored customization to align with design and functional needs.\n- **Performance and scalability considerations**: Choose storage solutions that are both high-performing and scalable, to support increasing traffic and content size effectively.\n- **Cost and integration**: Balance the costs of storage and bandwidth with the need for easy integration into your Next.js framework and broader tech ecosystem.\n\n### Using Vercel Blob for video hosting\n\n[Vercel Blob](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-blob?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=next-website) offers an efficient way to host videos, providing a scalable cloud storage solution that works well with Next.js. Here's how you can host a video using Vercel Blob:\n\n**1. Uploading a video to Vercel Blob**\n\nIn your Vercel dashboard, navigate to the \"Storage\" tab and select your [Vercel Blob](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-blob?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=next-website) store. In the Blob table's upper-right corner, find and click the \"Upload\" button. Then, choose the video file you wish to upload. After the upload completes, the video file will appear in the Blob table.\n\nAlternatively, you can upload your video using a server action. For detailed instructions, refer to the Vercel documentation on [server-side uploads](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-blob/server-upload). Vercel also supports [client-side uploads](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-blob/client-upload). This method may be preferable for certain use cases.\n\n**2. Displaying the video in Next.js**\n\nOnce the video is uploaded and stored, you can display it in your Next.js application. Here's an example of how to do this using the `<video>` tag and React Suspense:\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/page.jsx\"\nimport { Suspense } from 'react'\nimport { list } from '@vercel/blob'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <Suspense fallback={<p>Loading video...</p>}>\n      <VideoComponent fileName=\"my-video.mp4\" />\n    </Suspense>\n  )\n}\n\nasync function VideoComponent({ fileName }) {\n  const { blobs } = await list({\n    prefix: fileName,\n    limit: 1,\n  })\n  const { url } = blobs[0]\n\n  return (\n    <video controls preload=\"none\" aria-label=\"Video player\">\n      <source src={url} type=\"video/mp4\" />\n      Your browser does not support the video tag.\n    </video>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nIn this approach, the page uses the video's `@vercel/blob` URL to display the video using the `VideoComponent`. React Suspense is used to show a fallback until the video URL is fetched and the video is ready to be displayed.\n\n### Adding subtitles to your video\n\nIf you have subtitles for your video, you can easily add them using the `<track>` element inside your `<video>` tag. You can fetch the subtitle file from [Vercel Blob](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-blob?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=next-website) in a similar way as the video file. Here's how you can update the `<VideoComponent>` to include subtitles.\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/page.jsx\"\nasync function VideoComponent({ fileName }) {\n  const { blobs } = await list({\n    prefix: fileName,\n    limit: 2,\n  })\n  const { url } = blobs[0]\n  const { url: captionsUrl } = blobs[1]\n\n  return (\n    <video controls preload=\"none\" aria-label=\"Video player\">\n      <source src={url} type=\"video/mp4\" />\n      <track src={captionsUrl} kind=\"subtitles\" srcLang=\"en\" label=\"English\" />\n      Your browser does not support the video tag.\n    </video>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nBy following this approach, you can effectively self-host and integrate videos into your Next.js applications.\n\n## Resources\n\nTo continue learning more about video optimization and best practices, please refer to the following resources:\n\n- **Understanding video formats and codecs**: Choose the right format and codec, like MP4 for compatibility or WebM for web optimization, for your video needs. For more details, see [Mozilla's guide on video codecs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Video_codecs).\n- **Video compression**: Use tools like FFmpeg to effectively compress videos, balancing quality with file size. Learn about compression techniques at [FFmpeg's official website](https://www.ffmpeg.org/).\n- **Resolution and bitrate adjustment**: Adjust [resolution and bitrate](https://www.dacast.com/blog/bitrate-vs-resolution/#:~:text=The%20two%20measure%20different%20aspects,yield%20different%20qualities%20of%20video) based on the viewing platform, with lower settings for mobile devices.\n- **Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)**: Utilize a CDN to enhance video delivery speed and manage high traffic. When using some storage solutions, such as Vercel Blob, CDN functionality is automatically handled for you.

You can either use the `useReportWebVitals` hook to manage reporting yourself, or alternatively, Vercel provides a [managed service](https://vercel.com/analytics?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=next-website) to automatically collect and visualize metrics for you.\n\n## Build Your Own\n\n<PagesOnly>\n\n```jsx filename=\"pages/_app.js\"\nimport { useReportWebVitals } from 'next/web-vitals'\n\nfunction MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {\n  useReportWebVitals((metric) => {\n    console.log(metric)\n  })\n\n  return <Component {...pageProps} />\n}\n```\n\nView the [API Reference](/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/use-report-web-vitals) for more information.\n\n</PagesOnly>\n\n<AppOnly>\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/_components/web-vitals.js\"\n'use client'\n\nimport { useReportWebVitals } from 'next/web-vitals'\n\nexport function WebVitals() {\n  useReportWebVitals((metric) => {\n    console.log(metric)\n  })\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/layout.js\"\nimport { WebVitals } from './_components/web-vitals'\n\nexport default function Layout({ children }) {\n  return (\n    <html>\n      <body>\n        <WebVitals />\n        {children}\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n> Since the `useReportWebVitals` hook requires the `\"use client\"` directive, the most performant approach is to create a separate component that the root layout imports. This confines the client boundary exclusively to the `WebVitals` component.\n\nView the [API Reference](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-report-web-vitals) for more information.\n\n</AppOnly>\n\n## Web Vitals\n\n[Web Vitals](https://web.dev/vitals/) are a set of useful metrics that aim to capture the user\nexperience of a web page. The following web vitals are all included:\n\n- [Time to First Byte](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Glossary/Time_to_first_byte) (TTFB)\n- [First Contentful Paint](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Glossary/First_contentful_paint) (FCP)\n- [Largest Contentful Paint](https://web.dev/lcp/) (LCP)\n- [First Input Delay](https://web.dev/fid/) (FID)\n- [Cumulative Layout Shift](https://web.dev/cls/) (CLS)\n- [Interaction to Next Paint](https://web.dev/inp/) (INP)\n\nYou can handle all the results of these metrics using the `name` property.\n\n<PagesOnly>\n\n```jsx filename=\"pages/_app.js\"\nimport { useReportWebVitals } from 'next/web-vitals'\n\nfunction MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {\n  useReportWebVitals((metric) => {\n    switch (metric.name) {\n      case 'FCP': {\n        // handle FCP results\n      }\n      case 'LCP': {\n        // handle LCP results\n      }\n      // ...\n    }\n  })\n\n  return <Component {...pageProps} />\n}\n```\n\n</PagesOnly>\n\n<AppOnly>\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/_components/web-vitals.tsx\" switcher\n'use client'\n\nimport { useReportWebVitals } from 'next/web-vitals'\n\nexport function WebVitals() {\n  useReportWebVitals((metric) => {\n    switch (metric.name) {\n      case 'FCP': {\n        // handle FCP results\n      }\n      case 'LCP': {\n        // handle LCP results\n      }\n      // ...\n    }\n  })\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/_components/web-vitals.js\" switcher\n'use client'\n\nimport { useReportWebVitals } from 'next/web-vitals'\n\nexport function WebVitals() {\n  useReportWebVitals((metric) => {\n    switch (metric.name) {\n      case 'FCP': {\n        // handle FCP results\n      }\n      case 'LCP': {\n        // handle LCP results\n      }\n      // ...\n    }\n  })\n}\n```\n\n</AppOnly>\n\n<PagesOnly>\n\n## Custom Metrics\n\nIn addition to the core metrics listed above, there are some additional custom metrics that\nmeasure the time it takes for the page to hydrate and render:\n\n- `Next.js-hydration`: Length of time it takes for the page to start and finish hydrating (in ms)\n- `Next.js-route-change-to-render`: Length of time it takes for a page to start rendering after a\n  route change (in ms)\n- `Next.js-render`: Length of time it takes for a page to finish render after a route change (in ms)\n\nYou can handle all the results of these metrics separately:\n\n```js\nexport function reportWebVitals(metric) {\n  switch (metric.name) {\n    case 'Next.js-hydration':\n      // handle hydration results\n      break\n    case 'Next.js-route-change-to-render':\n      // handle route-change to render results\n      break\n    case 'Next.js-render':\n      // handle render results\n      break\n    default:\n      break\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThese metrics work in all browsers that support the [User Timing API](https://caniuse.com/#feat=user-timing).\n\n</PagesOnly>\n\n## Sending results to external systems\n\nYou can send results to any endpoint to measure and track\nreal user performance on your site. For example:\n\n```js\nuseReportWebVitals((metric) => {\n  const body = JSON.stringify(metric)\n  const url = 'https://example.com/analytics'\n\n  // Use `navigator.sendBeacon()` if available, falling back to `fetch()`.\n  if (navigator.sendBeacon) {\n    navigator.sendBeacon(url, body)\n  } else {\n    fetch(url, { body, method: 'POST', keepalive: true })\n  }\n})\n```\n\n> **Good to know**: If you use [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/), using the\n> `id` value can allow you to construct metric distributions manually (to calculate percentiles,\n> etc.)\n\n> ```js\n> useReportWebVitals((metric) => {\n>   // Use `window.gtag` if you initialized Google Analytics as this example:\n>   // https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/examples/with-google-analytics/pages/_app.js\n>   window.gtag('event', metric.name, {\n>     value: Math.round(\n>       metric.name === 'CLS' ? metric.value * 1000 : metric.value\n>     ), // values must be integers\n>     event_label: metric.id, // id unique to current page load\n>     non_interaction: true, // avoids affecting bounce rate.\n>   })\n> })\n> ```\n>\n> Read more about [sending results to Google Analytics](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/web-vitals#send-the-results-to-google-analytics).\n"},{"path":"docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/06-optimizing/03-fonts.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/06-optimizing/03-fonts.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts","sha":"7cbe7d29f95a657e51e79e394d19b7ab16a67bea","size":16179,"content":"---\ntitle: Font Optimization\nnav_title: Fonts\ndescription: Optimize your application's web fonts with the built-in `next/font` loaders.\nrelated:\n  title: API Reference\n  description: Learn more about the next/font API.\n  links:\n    - app/api-reference/components/font\n---\n\n{/* The content of this doc is shared between the app and pages router.

We recommend using [variable fonts](https://fonts.google.com/variablefonts) for the best performance and flexibility.\n\n<AppOnly>\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/layout.tsx\" switcher\nimport { Inter } from 'next/font/google'\n\n// If loading a variable font, you don't need to specify the font weight\nconst inter = Inter({\n  subsets: ['latin'],\n  display: 'swap',\n})\n\nexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\" className={inter.className}>\n      <body>{children}</body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/layout.js\" switcher\nimport { Inter } from 'next/font/google'\n\n// If loading a variable font, you don't need to specify the font weight\nconst inter = Inter({\n  subsets: ['latin'],\n  display: 'swap',\n})\n\nexport default function RootLayout({ children }) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\" className={inter.className}>\n      <body>{children}</body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nIf you can't use a variable font, you will **need to specify a weight**:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/layout.tsx\" switcher\nimport { Roboto } from 'next/font/google'\n\nconst roboto = Roboto({\n  weight: '400',\n  subsets: ['latin'],\n  display: 'swap',\n})\n\nexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\" className={roboto.className}>\n      <body>{children}</body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/layout.js\" switcher\nimport { Roboto } from 'next/font/google'\n\nconst roboto = Roboto({\n  weight: '400',\n  subsets: ['latin'],\n  display: 'swap',\n})\n\nexport default function RootLayout({ children }) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\" className={roboto.className}>\n      <body>{children}</body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n</AppOnly>\n\n<PagesOnly>\n\nTo use the font in all your pages, add it to [`_app.js` file](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/custom-app) under `/pages` as shown below:\n\n```jsx filename=\"pages/_app.js\"\nimport { Inter } from 'next/font/google'\n\n// If loading a variable font, you don't need to specify the font weight\nconst inter = Inter({ subsets: ['latin'] })\n\nexport default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {\n  return (\n    <main className={inter.className}>\n      <Component {...pageProps} />\n    </main>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nIf you can't use a variable font, you will **need to specify a weight**:\n\n```jsx filename=\"pages/_app.js\"\nimport { Roboto } from 'next/font/google'\n\nconst roboto = Roboto({\n  weight: '400',\n  subsets: ['latin'],\n})\n\nexport default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {\n  return (\n    <main className={roboto.className}>\n      <Component {...pageProps} />\n    </main>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n</PagesOnly>\n\nYou can specify multiple weights and/or styles by using an array:\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/layout.js\"\nconst roboto = Roboto({\n  weight: ['400', '700'],\n  style: ['normal', 'italic'],\n  subsets: ['latin'],\n  display: 'swap',\n})\n```\n\n> **Good to know**: Use an underscore (\\_) for font names with multiple words. E.g. `Roboto Mono` should be imported as `Roboto_Mono`.\n\n<PagesOnly>\n\n### Apply the font in `<head>`\n\nYou can also use the font without a wrapper and `className` by injecting it inside the `<head>` as follows:\n\n```jsx filename=\"pages/_app.js\"\nimport { Inter } from 'next/font/google'\n\nconst inter = Inter({ subsets: ['latin'] })\n\nexport default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <style jsx global>{`\n        html {\n          font-family: ${inter.style.fontFamily};\n        }\n      `}</style>\n      <Component {...pageProps} />\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### Single page usage\n\nTo use the font on a single page, add it to the specific page as shown below:\n\n```jsx filename=\"pages/index.js\"\nimport { Inter } from 'next/font/google'\n\nconst inter = Inter({ subsets: ['latin'] })\n\nexport default function Home() {\n  return (\n    <div className={inter.className}>\n      <p>Hello World</p>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n</PagesOnly>\n\n### Specifying a subset\n\nGoogle Fonts are automatically [subset](https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/subsetting). This reduces the size of the font file and improves performance. You'll need to define which of these subsets you want to preload. Failing to specify any subsets while [`preload`](/docs/app/api-reference/components/font#preload) is `true` will result in a warning.\n\nThis can be done by adding it to the function call:\n\n<AppOnly>\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/layout.tsx\" switcher\nconst inter = Inter({ subsets: ['latin'] })\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/layout.js\" switcher\nconst inter = Inter({ subsets: ['latin'] })\n```\n\n</AppOnly>\n\n<PagesOnly>\n\n```jsx filename=\"pages/_app.js\"\nconst inter = Inter({ subsets: ['latin'] })\n```\n\n</PagesOnly>\n\nView the [Font API Reference](/docs/app/api-reference/components/font) for more information.\n\n### Using Multiple Fonts\n\nYou can import and use multiple fonts in your application. There are two approaches you can take.\n\nThe first approach is to create a utility function that exports a font, imports it, and applies its `className` where needed. This ensures the font is preloaded only when it's rendered:\n\n```ts filename=\"app/fonts.ts\" switcher\nimport { Inter, Roboto_Mono } from 'next/font/google'\n\nexport const inter = Inter({\n  subsets: ['latin'],\n  display: 'swap',\n})\n\nexport const roboto_mono = Roboto_Mono({\n  subsets: ['latin'],\n  display: 'swap',\n})\n```\n\n```js filename=\"app/fonts.js\" switcher\nimport { Inter, Roboto_Mono } from 'next/font/google'\n\nexport const inter = Inter({\n  subsets: ['latin'],\n  display: 'swap',\n})\n\nexport const roboto_mono = Roboto_Mono({\n  subsets: ['latin'],\n  display: 'swap',\n})\n```\n\n<AppOnly>\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/layout.tsx\" switcher\nimport { inter } from './fonts'\n\nexport default function Layout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\" className={inter.className}>\n      <body>\n        <div>{children}</div>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/layout.js\" switcher\nimport { inter } from './fonts'\n\nexport default function Layout({ children }) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\" className={inter.className}>\n      <body>\n        <div>{children}</div>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/page.tsx\" switcher\nimport { roboto_mono } from './fonts'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h1 className={roboto_mono.className}>My page</h1>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/page.js\" switcher\nimport { roboto_mono } from './fonts'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h1 className={roboto_mono.className}>My page</h1>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n</AppOnly>\n\nIn the example above, `Inter` will be applied globally, and `Roboto Mono` can be imported and applied as needed.\n\nAlternatively, you can create a [CSS variable](/docs/app/api-reference/components/font#variable) and use it with your preferred CSS solution:\n\n<AppOnly>\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/layout.tsx\" switcher\nimport { Inter, Roboto_Mono } from 'next/font/google'\nimport styles from './global.css'\n\nconst inter = Inter({\n  subsets: ['latin'],\n  variable: '--font-inter',\n  display: 'swap',\n})\n\nconst roboto_mono = Roboto_Mono({\n  subsets: ['latin'],\n  variable: '--font-roboto-mono',\n  display: 'swap',\n})\n\nexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\" className={`${inter.variable} ${roboto_mono.variable}`}>\n      <body>\n        <h1>My App</h1>\n        <div>{children}</div>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/layout.js\" switcher\nimport { Inter, Roboto_Mono } from 'next/font/google'\n\nconst inter = Inter({\n  subsets: ['latin'],\n  variable: '--font-inter',\n  display: 'swap',\n})\n\nconst roboto_mono = Roboto_Mono({\n  subsets: ['latin'],\n  variable: '--font-roboto-mono',\n  display: 'swap',\n})\n\nexport default function RootLayout({ children }) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\" className={`${inter.variable} ${roboto_mono.variable}`}>\n      <body>\n        <h1>My App</h1>\n        <div>{children}</div>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n</AppOnly>\n\n```css filename=\"app/global.css\"\nhtml {\n  font-family: var(--font-inter);\n}\n\nh1 {\n  font-family: var(--font-roboto-mono);\n}\n```\n\nIn the example above, `Inter` will be applied globally, and any `<h1>` tags will be styled with `Roboto Mono`.\n\n> **Recommendation**: Use multiple fonts conservatively since each new font is an additional resource the client has to download.\n\n## Local Fonts\n\nImport `next/font/local` and specify the `src` of your local font file. We recommend using [variable fonts](https://fonts.google.com/variablefonts) for the best performance and flexibility.\n\n<AppOnly>\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/layout.tsx\" switcher\nimport localFont from 'next/font/local'\n\n// Font files can be colocated inside of `app`\nconst myFont = localFont({\n  src: './my-font.woff2',\n  display: 'swap',\n})\n\nexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\" className={myFont.className}>\n      <body>{children}</body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/layout.js\" switcher\nimport localFont from 'next/font/local'\n\n// Font files can be colocated inside of `app`\nconst myFont = localFont({\n  src: './my-font.woff2',\n  display: 'swap',\n})\n\nexport default function RootLayout({ children }) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\" className={myFont.className}>\n      <body>{children}</body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n</AppOnly>\n\n<PagesOnly>\n\n```jsx filename=\"pages/_app.js\"\nimport localFont from 'next/font/local'\n\n// Font files can be colocated inside of `pages`\nconst myFont = localFont({ src: './my-font.woff2' })\n\nexport default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {\n  return (\n    <main className={myFont.className}>\n      <Component {...pageProps} />\n    </main>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n</PagesOnly>\n\nIf you want to use multiple files for a single font family, `src` can be an array:\n\n```js\nconst roboto = localFont({\n  src: [\n    {\n      path: './Roboto-Regular.woff2',\n      weight: '400',\n      style: 'normal',\n    },\n    {\n      path: './Roboto-Italic.woff2',\n      weight: '400',\n      style: 'italic',\n    },\n    {\n      path: './Roboto-Bold.woff2',\n      weight: '700',\n      style: 'normal',\n    },\n    {\n      path: './Roboto-BoldItalic.woff2',\n      weight: '700',\n      style: 'italic',\n    },\n  ],\n})\n```\n\nView the [Font API Reference](/docs/app/api-reference/components/font) for more information.\n\n## With Tailwind CSS\n\n`next/font` can be used with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) through a [CSS variable](/docs/app/api-reference/components/font#css-variables).\n\nIn the example below, we use the font `Inter` from `next/font/google` (you can use any font from Google or Local Fonts). Load your font with the `variable` option to define your CSS variable name and assign it to `inter`. Then, use `inter.variable` to add the CSS variable to your HTML document.\n\n<AppOnly>\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/layout.tsx\" switcher\nimport { Inter, Roboto_Mono } from 'next/font/google'\n\nconst inter = Inter({\n  subsets: ['latin'],\n  display: 'swap',\n  variable: '--font-inter',\n})\n\nconst roboto_mono = Roboto_Mono({\n  subsets: ['latin'],\n  display: 'swap',\n  variable: '--font-roboto-mono',\n})\n\nexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\" className={`${inter.variable} ${roboto_mono.variable}`}>\n      <body>{children}</body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/layout.js\" switcher\nimport { Inter, Roboto_Mono } from 'next/font/google'\n\nconst inter = Inter({\n  subsets: ['latin'],\n  display: 'swap',\n  variable: '--font-inter',\n})\n\nconst roboto_mono = Roboto_Mono({\n  subsets: ['latin'],\n  display: 'swap',\n  variable: '--font-roboto-mono',\n})\n\nexport default function RootLayout({ children }) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\" className={`${inter.variable} ${roboto_mono.variable}`}>\n      <body>{children}</body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n</AppOnly>\n\n<PagesOnly>\n\n```jsx filename=\"pages/_app.js\"\nimport { Inter } from 'next/font/google'\n\nconst inter = Inter({\n  subsets: ['latin'],\n  variable: '--font-inter',\n})\n\nexport default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {\n  return (\n    <main className={`${inter.variable} font-sans`}>\n      <Component {...pageProps} />\n    </main>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n</PagesOnly>\n\nFinally, add the CSS variable to your [Tailwind CSS config](/docs/app/building-your-application/styling/tailwind-css#configuring-tailwind):\n\n```js filename=\"tailwind.config.js\"\n/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */\nmodule.exports = {\n  content: [\n    './pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',\n    './components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',\n    './app/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',\n  ],\n  theme: {\n    extend: {\n      fontFamily: {\n        sans: ['var(--font-inter)'],\n        mono: ['var(--font-roboto-mono)'],\n      },\n    },\n  },\n  plugins: [],\n}\n```\n\nYou can now use the `font-sans` and `font-mono` utility classes to apply the font to your elements.\n\n## Preloading\n\n<AppOnly>\nWhen a font function is called on a page of your site, it is not globally available and preloaded on all routes. Rather, the font is only preloaded on the related routes based on the type of file where it is used:\n\n- If it's a [unique page](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/pages), it is preloaded on the unique route for that page.\n- If it's a [layout](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/layouts-and-templates#layouts), it is preloaded on all the routes wrapped by the layout.\n- If it's the [root layout](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/layouts-and-templates#root-layout-required), it is preloaded on all routes.\n\n</AppOnly>\n\n<PagesOnly>\n\nWhen a font function is called on a page of your site, it is not globally available and preloaded on all routes. Rather, the font is only preloaded on the related route/s based on the type of file where it is used:\n\n- if it's a [unique page](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts), it is preloaded on the unique route for that page\n- if it's in the [custom App](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/custom-app), it is preloaded on all the routes of the site under `/pages`\n\n</PagesOnly>\n\n## Reusing fonts\n\nEvery time you call the `localFont` or Google font function, that font is hosted as one instance in your application. Therefore, if you load the same font function in multiple files, multiple instances of the same font are hosted. In this situation, it is recommended to do the following:\n\n- Call the font loader function in one shared file\n- Export it as a constant\n- Import the constant in each file where you would like to use this font\n"},{"path":"docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/06-optimizing/01-images.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/06-optimizing/01-images.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/images","sha":"76f210fbb17b20bb3f597d08d8800ea1ff348a4c","size":14356,"content":"---\ntitle: Image Optimization\nnav_title: Images\ndescription: Optimize your images with the built-in `next/image` component.\nrelated:\n  title: API Reference\n  description: Learn more about the next/image API.\n  links:\n    - app/api-reference/components/image\n---\n\n{/* The content of this doc is shared between the app and pages router.

These values are used to prevent [Cumulative Layout Shift](https://nextjs.org/learn/seo/web-performance/cls) while your image is loading.\n\n<AppOnly>\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/page.js\"\nimport Image from 'next/image'\nimport profilePic from './me.png'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <Image\n      src={profilePic}\n      alt=\"Picture of the author\"\n      // width={500} automatically provided\n      // height={500} automatically provided\n      // blurDataURL=\"data:...\" automatically provided\n      // placeholder=\"blur\" // Optional blur-up while loading\n    />\n  )\n}\n```\n\n</AppOnly>\n\n<PagesOnly>\n\n```jsx filename=\"pages/index.js\"\nimport Image from 'next/image'\nimport profilePic from '../public/me.png'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <Image\n      src={profilePic}\n      alt=\"Picture of the author\"\n      // width={500} automatically provided\n      // height={500} automatically provided\n      // blurDataURL=\"data:...\" automatically provided\n      // placeholder=\"blur\" // Optional blur-up while loading\n    />\n  )\n}\n```\n\n</PagesOnly>\n\n> **Warning:** Dynamic `await import()` or `require()` are _not_ supported. The `import` must be static so it can be analyzed at build time.\n\n### Remote Images\n\nTo use a remote image, the `src` property should be a URL string.\n\nSince Next.js does not have access to remote files during the build process, you'll need to provide the [`width`](/docs/app/api-reference/components/image#width), [`height`](/docs/app/api-reference/components/image#height) and optional [`blurDataURL`](/docs/app/api-reference/components/image#blurdataurl) props manually.\n\nThe `width` and `height` attributes are used to infer the correct aspect ratio of image and avoid layout shift from the image loading in. The `width` and `height` do _not_ determine the rendered size of the image file. Learn more about [Image Sizing](#image-sizing).\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/page.js\"\nimport Image from 'next/image'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <Image\n      src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/my-bucket/profile.png\"\n      alt=\"Picture of the author\"\n      width={500}\n      height={500}\n    />\n  )\n}\n```\n\nTo safely allow optimizing images, define a list of supported URL patterns in `next.config.js`. Be as specific as possible to prevent malicious usage. For example, the following configuration will only allow images from a specific AWS S3 bucket:\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    remotePatterns: [\n      {\n        protocol: 'https',\n        hostname: 's3.amazonaws.com',\n        port: '',\n        pathname: '/my-bucket/**',\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n}\n```\n\nLearn more about [`remotePatterns`](/docs/app/api-reference/components/image#remotepatterns) configuration. If you want to use relative URLs for the image `src`, use a [`loader`](/docs/app/api-reference/components/image#loader).\n\n### Domains\n\nSometimes you may want to optimize a remote image, but still use the built-in Next.js Image Optimization API. To do this, leave the `loader` at its default setting and enter an absolute URL for the Image `src` prop.\n\nTo protect your application from malicious users, you must define a list of remote hostnames you intend to use with the `next/image` component.\n\n> Learn more about [`remotePatterns`](/docs/app/api-reference/components/image#remotepatterns) configuration.\n\n### Loaders\n\nNote that in the [example earlier](#local-images), a partial URL (`\"/me.png\"`) is provided for a local image. This is possible because of the loader architecture.\n\nA loader is a function that generates the URLs for your image. It modifies the provided `src`, and generates multiple URLs to request the image at different sizes. These multiple URLs are used in the automatic [srcset](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/HTMLImageElement/srcset) generation, so that visitors to your site will be served an image that is the right size for their viewport.\n\nThe default loader for Next.js applications uses the built-in Image Optimization API, which optimizes images from anywhere on the web, and then serves them directly from the Next.js web server. If you would like to serve your images directly from a CDN or image server, you can write your own loader function with a few lines of JavaScript.\n\nYou can define a loader per-image with the [`loader` prop](/docs/app/api-reference/components/image#loader), or at the application level with the [`loaderFile` configuration](/docs/app/api-reference/components/image#loaderfile).\n\n## Priority\n\nYou should add the `priority` property to the image that will be the [Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) element](https://web.dev/lcp/#what-elements-are-considered) for each page. Doing so allows Next.js to specially prioritize the image for loading (e.g. through preload tags or priority hints), leading to a meaningful boost in LCP.\n\nThe LCP element is typically the largest image or text block visible within the viewport of the page. When you run `next dev`, you'll see a console warning if the LCP element is an `<Image>` without the `priority` property.\n\nOnce you've identified the LCP image, you can add the property like this:\n\n<PagesOnly>\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/page.js\"\nimport Image from 'next/image'\n\nexport default function Home() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h1>My Homepage</h1>\n      <Image\n        src=\"/me.png\"\n        alt=\"Picture of the author\"\n        width={500}\n        height={500}\n        priority\n      />\n      <p>Welcome to my homepage!</p>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n</PagesOnly>\n\n<AppOnly>\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/page.js\"\nimport Image from 'next/image'\nimport profilePic from '../public/me.png'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return <Image src={profilePic} alt=\"Picture of the author\" priority />\n}\n```\n\n</AppOnly>\n\nSee more about priority in the [`next/image` component documentation](/docs/app/api-reference/components/image#priority).\n\n## Image Sizing\n\nOne of the ways that images most commonly hurt performance is through _layout shift_, where the image pushes other elements around on the page as it loads in. This performance problem is so annoying to users that it has its own Core Web Vital, called [Cumulative Layout Shift](https://web.dev/cls/). The way to avoid image-based layout shifts is to [always size your images](https://web.dev/optimize-cls/#images-without-dimensions). This allows the browser to reserve precisely enough space for the image before it loads.\n\nBecause `next/image` is designed to guarantee good performance results, it cannot be used in a way that will contribute to layout shift, and **must** be sized in one of three ways:\n\n1. Automatically, using a [static import](#local-images)\n2. Explicitly, by including a [`width`](/docs/app/api-reference/components/image#width) and [`height`](/docs/app/api-reference/components/image#height) property\n3. Implicitly, by using [fill](/docs/app/api-reference/components/image#fill) which causes the image to expand to fill its parent element.\n\n> **What if I don't know the size of my images?**\n>\n> If you are accessing images from a source without knowledge of the images' sizes, there are several things you can do:\n>\n> **Use `fill`**\n>\n> The [`fill`](/docs/app/api-reference/components/image#fill) prop allows your image to be sized by its parent element. Consider using CSS to give the image's parent element space on the page along [`sizes`](/docs/app/api-reference/components/image#sizes) prop to match any media query break points. You can also use [`object-fit`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/object-fit) with `fill`, `contain`, or `cover`, and [`object-position`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/object-position) to define how the image should occupy that space.\n>\n> **Normalize your images**\n>\n> If you're serving images from a source that you control, consider modifying your image pipeline to normalize the images to a specific size.\n>\n> **Modify your API calls**\n>\n> If your application is retrieving image URLs using an API call (such as to a CMS), you may be able to modify the API call to return the image dimensions along with the URL.\n\nIf none of the suggested methods works for sizing your images, the `next/image` component is designed to work well on a page alongside standard `<img>` elements.\n\n## Styling\n\nStyling the Image component is similar to styling a normal `<img>` element, but there are a few guidelines to keep in mind:\n\n- Use `className` or `style`, not `styled-jsx`.\n  - In most cases, we recommend using the `className` prop. This can be an imported [CSS Module](/docs/app/building-your-application/styling/css-modules), a [global stylesheet](/docs/app/building-your-application/styling/css-modules#global-styles), etc.\n  - You can also use the `style` prop to assign inline styles.\n  - You cannot use [styled-jsx](/docs/app/building-your-application/styling/css-in-js) because it's scoped to the current component (unless you mark the style as `global`).\n- When using `fill`, the parent element must have `position: relative`\n  - This is necessary for the proper rendering of the image element in that layout mode.\n- When using `fill`, the parent element must have `display: block`\n  - This is the default for `<div>` elements but should be specified otherwise.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Responsive\n\n<Image\n  alt=\"Responsive image filling the width and height of its parent container\"\n  srcLight=\"/docs/light/responsive-image.png\"\n  srcDark=\"/docs/dark/responsive-image.png\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"629\"\n/>\n\n```jsx\nimport Image from 'next/image'\nimport mountains from '../public/mountains.jpg'\n\nexport default function Responsive() {\n  return (\n    <div style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column' }}>\n      <Image\n        alt=\"Mountains\"\n        // Importing an image will\n        // automatically set the width and height\n        src={mountains}\n        sizes=\"100vw\"\n        // Make the image display full width\n        style={{\n          width: '100%',\n          height: 'auto',\n        }}\n      />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### Fill Container\n\n<Image\n  alt=\"Grid of images filling parent container width\"\n  srcLight=\"/docs/light/fill-container.png\"\n  srcDark=\"/docs/dark/fill-container.png\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"529\"\n/>\n\n```jsx\nimport Image from 'next/image'\nimport mountains from '../public/mountains.jpg'\n\nexport default function Fill() {\n  return (\n    <div\n      style={{\n        display: 'grid',\n        gridGap: '8px',\n        gridTemplateColumns: 'repeat(auto-fit, minmax(400px, auto))',\n      }}\n    >\n      <div style={{ position: 'relative', height: '400px' }}>\n        <Image\n          alt=\"Mountains\"\n          src={mountains}\n          fill\n          sizes=\"(min-width: 808px) 50vw, 100vw\"\n          style={{\n            objectFit: 'cover', // cover, contain, none\n          }}\n        />\n      </div>\n      {/* And more images in the grid... */}\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### Background Image\n\n<Image\n  alt=\"Background image taking full width and height of page\"\n  srcLight=\"/docs/light/background-image.png\"\n  srcDark=\"/docs/dark/background-image.png\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"427\"\n/>\n\n```jsx\nimport Image from 'next/image'\nimport mountains from '../public/mountains.jpg'\n\nexport default function Background() {\n  return (\n    <Image\n      alt=\"Mountains\"\n      src={mountains}\n      placeholder=\"blur\"\n      quality={100}\n      fill\n      sizes=\"100vw\"\n      style={{\n        objectFit: 'cover',\n      }}\n    />\n  )\n}\n```\n\nFor examples of the Image component used with the various styles, see the [Image Component Demo](https://image-component.nextjs.gallery).\n\n## Other Properties\n\n[**View all properties available to the `next/image` component.**](/docs/app/api-reference/components/image)\n\n## Configuration\n\nThe `next/image` component and Next.js Image Optimization API can be configured in the [`next.config.js` file](/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js).

Any shared content should not be wrapped in a component. */}\n\n[Lazy loading](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Performance/Lazy_loading) in Next.js helps improve the initial loading performance of an application by decreasing the amount of JavaScript needed to render a route.\n\nIt allows you to defer loading of **Client Components** and imported libraries, and only include them in the client bundle when they're needed. For example, you might want to defer loading a modal until a user clicks to open it.\n\nThere are two ways you can implement lazy loading in Next.js:\n\n1. Using [Dynamic Imports](#nextdynamic) with `next/dynamic`\n2. Using [`React.lazy()`](https://react.dev/reference/react/lazy) with [Suspense](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense)\n\nBy default, Server Components are automatically [code split](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Glossary/Code_splitting), and you can use [streaming](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/loading-ui-and-streaming) to progressively send pieces of UI from the server to the client. Lazy loading applies to Client Components.\n\n## `next/dynamic`\n\n`next/dynamic` is a composite of [`React.lazy()`](https://react.dev/reference/react/lazy) and [Suspense](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense). It behaves the same way in the `app` and `pages` directories to allow for incremental migration.\n\n## Examples\n\n<AppOnly>\n### Importing Client Components\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/page.js\"\n'use client'\n\nimport { useState } from 'react'\nimport dynamic from 'next/dynamic'\n\n// Client Components:\nconst ComponentA = dynamic(() => import('../components/A'))\nconst ComponentB = dynamic(() => import('../components/B'))\nconst ComponentC = dynamic(() => import('../components/C'), { ssr: false })\n\nexport default function ClientComponentExample() {\n  const [showMore, setShowMore] = useState(false)\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      {/* Load immediately, but in a separate client bundle */}\n      <ComponentA />\n\n      {/* Load on demand, only when/if the condition is met */}\n      {showMore && <ComponentB />}\n      <button onClick={() => setShowMore(!showMore)}>Toggle</button>\n\n      {/* Load only on the client side */}\n      <ComponentC />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### Skipping SSR\n\nWhen using `React.lazy()` and Suspense, Client Components will be pre-rendered (SSR) by default.\n\nIf you want to disable pre-rendering for a Client Component, you can use the `ssr` option set to `false`:\n\n```jsx\nconst ComponentC = dynamic(() => import('../components/C'), { ssr: false })\n```\n\n### Importing Server Components\n\nIf you dynamically import a Server Component, only the Client Components that are children of the Server Component will be lazy-loaded - not the Server Component itself.\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/page.js\"\nimport dynamic from 'next/dynamic'\n\n// Server Component:\nconst ServerComponent = dynamic(() => import('../components/ServerComponent'))\n\nexport default function ServerComponentExample() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <ServerComponent />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### Loading External Libraries\n\nExternal libraries can be loaded on demand using the [`import()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/import) function. This example uses the external library `fuse.js` for fuzzy search. The module is only loaded on the client after the user types in the search input.\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/page.js\"\n'use client'\n\nimport { useState } from 'react'\n\nconst names = ['Tim', 'Joe', 'Bel', 'Lee']\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  const [results, setResults] = useState()\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <input\n        type=\"text\"\n        placeholder=\"Search\"\n        onChange={async (e) => {\n          const { value } = e.currentTarget\n          // Dynamically load fuse.js\n          const Fuse = (await import('fuse.js')).default\n          const fuse = new Fuse(names)\n\n          setResults(fuse.search(value))\n        }}\n      />\n      <pre>Results: {JSON.stringify(results, null, 2)}</pre>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### Adding a custom loading component\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/page.js\"\nimport dynamic from 'next/dynamic'\n\nconst WithCustomLoading = dynamic(\n  () => import('../components/WithCustomLoading'),\n  {\n    loading: () => <p>Loading...</p>,\n  }\n)\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      {/* The loading component will be rendered while  <WithCustomLoading/> is loading */}\n      <WithCustomLoading />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### Importing Named Exports\n\nTo dynamically import a named export, you can return it from the Promise returned by [`import()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/import) function:\n\n```jsx filename=\"components/hello.js\"\n'use client'\n\nexport function Hello() {\n  return <p>Hello!</p>\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/page.js\"\nimport dynamic from 'next/dynamic'\n\nconst ClientComponent = dynamic(() =>\n  import('../components/hello').then((mod) => mod.Hello)\n)\n```\n\n</AppOnly>\n\n<PagesOnly>\n\nBy using `next/dynamic`, the header component will not be included in the page's initial JavaScript bundle. The page will render the Suspense `fallback` first, followed by the `Header` component when the `Suspense` boundary is resolved.\n\n```jsx\nimport dynamic from 'next/dynamic'\n\nconst DynamicHeader = dynamic(() => import('../components/header'), {\n  loading: () => <p>Loading...</p>,\n})\n\nexport default function Home() {\n  return <DynamicHeader />\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know**: In `import('path/to/component')`, the path must be explicitly written. It can't be a template string nor a variable. Furthermore the `import()` has to be inside the `dynamic()` call for Next.js to be able to match webpack bundles / module ids to the specific `dynamic()` call and preload them before rendering. `dynamic()` can't be used inside of React rendering as it needs to be marked in the top level of the module for preloading to work, similar to `React.lazy`.\n\n## With named exports\n\nTo dynamically import a named export, you can return it from the [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) returned by [`import()`](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-dynamic-import#example):\n\n```jsx filename=\"components/hello.js\"\nexport function Hello() {\n  return <p>Hello!</p>\n}\n\n// pages/index.js\nimport dynamic from 'next/dynamic'\n\nconst DynamicComponent = dynamic(() =>\n  import('../components/hello').then((mod) => mod.Hello)\n)\n```\n\n## With no SSR\n\nTo dynamically load a component on the client side, you can use the `ssr` option to disable server-rendering. This is useful if an external dependency or component relies on browser APIs like `window`.\n\n```jsx\nimport dynamic from 'next/dynamic'\n\nconst DynamicHeader = dynamic(() => import('../components/header'), {\n  ssr: false,\n})\n```\n\n## With external libraries\n\nThis example uses the external library `fuse.js` for fuzzy search. The module is only loaded in the browser after the user types in the search input.\n\n```jsx\nimport { useState } from 'react'\n\nconst names = ['Tim', 'Joe', 'Bel', 'Lee']\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  const [results, setResults] = useState()\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <input\n        type=\"text\"\n        placeholder=\"Search\"\n        onChange={async (e) => {\n          const { value } = e.currentTarget\n          // Dynamically load fuse.js\n          const Fuse = (await import('fuse.js')).default\n          const fuse = new Fuse(names)\n\n          setResults(fuse.search(value))\n        }}\n      />\n      <pre>Results: {JSON.stringify(results, null, 2)}</pre>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n</PagesOnly>\n"},{"path":"docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/06-optimizing/11-static-assets.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/06-optimizing/11-static-assets.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/static-assets","sha":"9212cc09cc13fcd5930b820c21fc6259f219253a","size":2344,"content":"---\ntitle: Static Assets in `public`\nnav_title: Static Assets\ndescription: Next.js allows you to serve static files, like images, in the public directory. You can learn how it works here.\n---\n\n{/* The content of this doc is shared between the app and pages router. You can use the `<PagesOnly>Content</PagesOnly>` component to add content that is specific to the Pages Router. Any shared content should not be wrapped in a component. */}\n\nNext.js can serve static files, like images, under a folder called `public` in the root directory. Files inside `public` can then be referenced by your code starting from the base URL (`/`).\n\nFor example, the file `public/avatars/me.png` can be viewed by visiting the `/avatars/me.png` path. The code to display that image might look like:\n\n```jsx filename=\"avatar.js\"\nimport Image from 'next/image'\n\nexport function Avatar({ id, alt }) {\n  return <Image src={`/avatars/${id}.png`} alt={alt} width=\"64\" height=\"64\" />\n}\n\nexport function AvatarOfMe() {\n  return <Avatar id=\"me\" alt=\"A portrait of me\" />\n}\n```\n\n## Caching\n\nNext.js cannot safely cache assets in the `public` folder because they may change. The default caching headers applied are:\n\n```jsx\nCache-Control: public, max-age=0\n```\n\n## Robots, Favicons, and others\n\n<PagesOnly>\n\nThe folder is also useful for `robots.txt`, `favicon.ico`, Google Site Verification, and any other static files (including `.html`). But make sure to not have a static file with the same name as a file in the `pages/` directory, as this will result in an error. [Read more](/docs/messages/conflicting-public-file-page).\n\n</PagesOnly>\n\n<AppOnly>\n\nFor static metadata files, such as `robots.txt`, `favicon.ico`, etc, you should use [special metadata files](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/metadata) inside the `app` folder.\n\n</AppOnly>\n\n> Good to know:\n>\n> - The directory must be named `public`. The name cannot be changed and it's the only directory used to serve static assets.\n> - Only assets that are in the `public` directory at [build time](/docs/app/api-reference/next-cli#build) will be served by Next.js. Files added at request time won't be available. We recommend using a third-party service like [Vercel Blob](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-blob?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=next-website) for persistent file storage.\n"},{"path":"docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/06-optimizing/04-metadata.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/06-optimizing/04-metadata.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/metadata","sha":"8e447b2137d06cda81cccab6b9646a4296391aac","size":13035,"content":"---\ntitle: Metadata\ndescription: Use the Metadata API to define metadata in any layout or page.\nrelated:\n  description: View all the Metadata API options.\n  links:\n    - app/api-reference/functions/generate-metadata\n    - app/api-reference/file-conventions/metadata\n    - app/api-reference/functions/generate-viewport\n---\n\nNext.js has a Metadata API that can be used to define your application metadata (e.g. `meta` and `link` tags inside your HTML `head` element) for improved SEO and web shareability.\n\nThere are two ways you can add metadata to your application:\n\n- **Config-based Metadata**: Export a [static `metadata` object](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-metadata#metadata-object) or a dynamic [`generateMetadata` function](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-metadata#generatemetadata-function) in a `layout.js` or `page.js` file.\n- **File-based Metadata**: Add static or dynamically generated special files to route segments.\n\nWith both these options, Next.js will automatically generate the relevant `<head>` elements for your pages. You can also create dynamic OG images using the [`ImageResponse`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/image-response) constructor.\n\n## Static Metadata\n\nTo define static metadata, export a [`Metadata` object](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-metadata#metadata-object) from a `layout.js` or static `page.js` file.\n\n```tsx filename=\"layout.tsx | page.tsx\" switcher\nimport type { Metadata } from 'next'\n\nexport const metadata: Metadata = {\n  title: '...',\n  description: '...',\n}\n\nexport default function Page() {}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"layout.js | page.js\" switcher\nexport const metadata = {\n  title: '...',\n  description: '...',\n}\n\nexport default function Page() {}\n```\n\nFor all the available options, see the [API Reference](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-metadata).\n\n## Dynamic Metadata\n\nYou can use `generateMetadata` function to `fetch` metadata that requires dynamic values.\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/products/[id]/page.tsx\" switcher\nimport type { Metadata, ResolvingMetadata } from 'next'\n\ntype Props = {\n  params: { id: string }\n  searchParams: { [key: string]: string | string[] | undefined }\n}\n\nexport async function generateMetadata(\n  { params, searchParams }: Props,\n  parent: ResolvingMetadata\n): Promise<Metadata> {\n  // read route params\n  const id = params.id\n\n  // fetch data\n  const product = await fetch(`https://.../${id}`).then((res) => res.json())\n\n  // optionally access and extend (rather than replace) parent metadata\n  const previousImages = (await parent).openGraph?.images || []\n\n  return {\n    title: product.title,\n    openGraph: {\n      images: ['/some-specific-page-image.jpg', ...previousImages],\n    },\n  }\n}\n\nexport default function Page({ params, searchParams }: Props) {}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/products/[id]/page.js\" switcher\nexport async function generateMetadata({ params, searchParams }, parent) {\n  // read route params\n  const id = params.id\n\n  // fetch data\n  const product = await fetch(`https://.../${id}`).then((res) => res.json())\n\n  // optionally access and extend (rather than replace) parent metadata\n  const previousImages = (await parent).openGraph?.images || []\n\n  return {\n    title: product.title,\n    openGraph: {\n      images: ['/some-specific-page-image.jpg', ...previousImages],\n    },\n  }\n}\n\nexport default function Page({ params, searchParams }) {}\n```\n\nFor all the available params, see the [API Reference](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-metadata).\n\n> **Good to know**:\n>\n> - Both static and dynamic metadata through `generateMetadata` are **only supported in Server Components**.\n> - `fetch` requests are automatically [memoized](/docs/app/building-your-application/caching#request-memoization) for the same data across `generateMetadata`, `generateStaticParams`, Layouts, Pages, and Server Components. React [`cache` can be used](/docs/app/building-your-application/caching#react-cache-function) if `fetch` is unavailable.\n> - Next.js will wait for data fetching inside `generateMetadata` to complete before streaming UI to the client. This guarantees the first part of a [streamed response](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/loading-ui-and-streaming) includes `<head>` tags.\n\n## File-based metadata\n\nThese special files are available for metadata:\n\n- [favicon.ico, apple-icon.jpg, and icon.jpg](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/metadata/app-icons)\n- [opengraph-image.jpg and twitter-image.jpg](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/metadata/opengraph-image)\n- [robots.txt](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/metadata/robots)\n- [sitemap.xml](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/metadata/sitemap)\n\nYou can use these for static metadata, or you can programmatically generate these files with code.\n\nFor implementation and examples, see the [Metadata Files](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/metadata) API Reference and [Dynamic Image Generation](#dynamic-image-generation).\n\n## Behavior\n\nFile-based metadata has the higher priority and will override any config-based metadata.\n\n### Default Fields\n\nThere are two default `meta` tags that are always added even if a route doesn't define metadata:\n\n- The [meta charset tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta#attr-charset) sets the character encoding for the website.\n- The [meta viewport tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Viewport_meta_tag) sets the viewport width and scale for the website to adjust for different devices.\n\n```html\n<meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" />\n```\n\n> **Good to know**: You can overwrite the default [`viewport`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-metadata#viewport) meta tag.\n\n### Ordering\n\nMetadata is evaluated in order, starting from the root segment down to the segment closest to the final `page.js` segment. For example:\n\n1. `app/layout.tsx` (Root Layout)\n2. `app/blog/layout.tsx` (Nested Blog Layout)\n3. `app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx` (Blog Page)\n\n### Merging\n\nFollowing the [evaluation order](#ordering), Metadata objects exported from multiple segments in the same route are **shallowly** merged together to form the final metadata output of a route. Duplicate keys are **replaced** based on their ordering.\n\nThis means metadata with nested fields such as [`openGraph`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-metadata#opengraph) and [`robots`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-metadata#robots) that are defined in an earlier segment are **overwritten** by the last segment to define them.\n\n#### Overwriting fields\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/layout.js\"\nexport const metadata = {\n  title: 'Acme',\n  openGraph: {\n    title: 'Acme',\n    description: 'Acme is a...',\n  },\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/blog/page.js\"\nexport const metadata = {\n  title: 'Blog',\n  openGraph: {\n    title: 'Blog',\n  },\n}\n\n// Output:\n// <title>Blog</title>\n// <meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"Blog\" />\n```\n\nIn the example above:\n\n- `title` from `app/layout.js` is **replaced** by `title` in `app/blog/page.js`.\n- All `openGraph` fields from `app/layout.js` are **replaced** in `app/blog/page.js` because `app/blog/page.js` sets `openGraph` metadata. Note the absence of `openGraph.description`.\n\nIf you'd like to share some nested fields between segments while overwriting others, you can pull them out into a separate variable:\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/shared-metadata.js\"\nexport const openGraphImage = { images: ['http://...'] }\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/page.js\"\nimport { openGraphImage } from './shared-metadata'\n\nexport const metadata = {\n  openGraph: {\n    ...openGraphImage,\n    title: 'Home',\n  },\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/about/page.js\"\nimport { openGraphImage } from '../shared-metadata'\n\nexport const metadata = {\n  openGraph: {\n    ...openGraphImage,\n    title: 'About',\n  },\n}\n```\n\nIn the example above, the OG image is shared between `app/layout.js` and `app/about/page.js` while the titles are different.\n\n#### Inheriting fields\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/layout.js\"\nexport const metadata = {\n  title: 'Acme',\n  openGraph: {\n    title: 'Acme',\n    description: 'Acme is a...',\n  },\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/about/page.js\"\nexport const metadata = {\n  title: 'About',\n}\n\n// Output:\n// <title>About</title>\n// <meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"Acme\" />\n// <meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"Acme is a...\" />\n```\n\n**Notes**\n\n- `title` from `app/layout.js` is **replaced** by `title` in `app/about/page.js`.\n- All `openGraph` fields from `app/layout.js` are **inherited** in `app/about/page.js` because `app/about/page.js` doesn't set `openGraph` metadata.\n\n## Dynamic Image Generation\n\nThe `ImageResponse` constructor allows you to generate dynamic images using JSX and CSS. This is useful for creating social media images such as Open Graph images, Twitter cards, and more.\n\nTo use it, you can import `ImageResponse` from `next/og`:\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/about/route.js\"\nimport { ImageResponse } from 'next/og'\n\nexport async function GET() {\n  return new ImageResponse(\n    (\n      <div\n        style={{\n          fontSize: 128,\n          background: 'white',\n          width: '100%',\n          height: '100%',\n          display: 'flex',\n          textAlign: 'center',\n          alignItems: 'center',\n          justifyContent: 'center',\n        }}\n      >\n        Hello world!\n      </div>\n    ),\n    {\n      width: 1200,\n      height: 600,\n    }\n  )\n}\n```\n\n`ImageResponse` integrates well with other Next.js APIs, including [Route Handlers](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-handlers) and file-based Metadata. For example, you can use `ImageResponse` in a `opengraph-image.tsx` file to generate Open Graph images at build time or dynamically at request time.\n\n`ImageResponse` supports common CSS properties including flexbox and absolute positioning, custom fonts, text wrapping, centering, and nested images. [See the full list of supported CSS properties](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/image-response).\n\n> **Good to know**:\n>\n> - Examples are available in the [Vercel OG Playground](https://og-playground.vercel.app/).\n> - `ImageResponse` uses [@vercel/og](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/edge-functions/og-image-generation), [Satori](https://github.com/vercel/satori), and Resvg to convert HTML and CSS into PNG.\n> - Only the Edge Runtime is supported. The default Node.js runtime will not work.\n> - Only flexbox and a subset of CSS properties are supported. Advanced layouts (e.g. `display: grid`) will not work.\n> - Maximum bundle size of `500KB`. The bundle size includes your JSX, CSS, fonts, images, and any other assets. If you exceed the limit, consider reducing the size of any assets or fetching at runtime.\n> - Only `ttf`, `otf`, and `woff` font formats are supported. To maximize the font parsing speed, `ttf` or `otf` are preferred over `woff`.\n\n## JSON-LD\n\n[JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/) is a format for structured data that can be used by search engines to understand your content. For example, you can use it to describe a person, an event, an organization, a movie, a book, a recipe, and many other types of entities.\n\nOur current recommendation for JSON-LD is to render structured data as a `<script>` tag in your `layout.js` or `page.js` components. For example:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/products/[id]/page.tsx\" switcher\nexport default async function Page({ params }) {\n  const product = await getProduct(params.id)\n\n  const jsonLd = {\n    '@context': 'https://schema.org',\n    '@type': 'Product',\n    name: product.name,\n    image: product.image,\n    description: product.description,\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <section>\n      {/* Add JSON-LD to your page */}\n      <script\n        type=\"application/ld+json\"\n        dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: JSON.stringify(jsonLd) }}\n      />\n      {/* ... */}\n    </section>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/products/[id]/page.js\" switcher\nexport default async function Page({ params }) {\n  const product = await getProduct(params.id)\n\n  const jsonLd = {\n    '@context': 'https://schema.org',\n    '@type': 'Product',\n    name: product.name,\n    image: product.image,\n    description: product.description,\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <section>\n      {/* Add JSON-LD to your page */}\n      <script\n        type=\"application/ld+json\"\n        dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: JSON.stringify(jsonLd) }}\n      />\n      {/* ... */}\n    </section>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nYou can validate and test your structured data with the [Rich Results Test](https://search.google.com/test/rich-results) for Google or the generic [Schema Markup Validator](https://validator.schema.org/).\n\nYou can type your JSON-LD with TypeScript using community packages like [`schema-dts`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/schema-dts):\n\n```tsx\nimport { Product, WithContext } from 'schema-dts'\n\nconst jsonLd: WithContext<Product> = {\n  '@context': 'https://schema.org',\n  '@type': 'Product',\n  name: 'Next.js Sticker',\n  image: 'https://nextjs.org/imgs/sticker.png',\n  description: 'Dynamic at the speed of static.',\n}\n```\n"},{"path":"docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/06-optimizing/12-third-party-libraries.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/06-optimizing/12-third-party-libraries.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/third-party-libraries","sha":"2003c269d4068153443cae39879c82d8d5ce669f","size":16097,"content":"---\ntitle: Third Party Libraries\ndescription: Optimize the performance of third-party libraries in your application with the `@next/third-parties` package.\n---\n\n{/* The content of this doc is shared between the app and pages router.

By default, it fetches the original inline script after hydration occurs on the page.\n\n<AppOnly>\n\nTo load Google Tag Manager for all routes, include the component directly in your root layout and pass in your GTM container ID:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/layout.tsx\" switcher\nimport { GoogleTagManager } from '@next/third-parties/google'\n\nexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <GoogleTagManager gtmId=\"GTM-XYZ\" />\n      <body>{children}</body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/layout.js\" switcher\nimport { GoogleTagManager } from '@next/third-parties/google'\n\nexport default function RootLayout({ children }) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <GoogleTagManager gtmId=\"GTM-XYZ\" />\n      <body>{children}</body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n</AppOnly>\n\n<PagesOnly>\n\nTo load Google Tag Manager for all routes, include the component directly in your custom `_app` and\npass in your GTM container ID:\n\n```jsx filename=\"pages/_app.js\"\nimport { GoogleTagManager } from '@next/third-parties/google'\n\nexport default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Component {...pageProps} />\n      <GoogleTagManager gtmId=\"GTM-XYZ\" />\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n</PagesOnly>\n\nTo load Google Tag Manager for a single route, include the component in your page file:\n\n<AppOnly>\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/page.js\"\nimport { GoogleTagManager } from '@next/third-parties/google'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return <GoogleTagManager gtmId=\"GTM-XYZ\" />\n}\n```\n\n</AppOnly>\n\n<PagesOnly>\n\n```jsx filename=\"pages/index.js\"\nimport { GoogleTagManager } from '@next/third-parties/google'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return <GoogleTagManager gtmId=\"GTM-XYZ\" />\n}\n```\n\n</PagesOnly>\n\n#### Sending Events\n\nThe `sendGTMEvent` function can be used to track user interactions on your page by sending events\nusing the `dataLayer` object. For this function to work, the `<GoogleTagManager />` component must be\nincluded in either a parent layout, page, or component, or directly in the same file.\n\n<AppOnly>\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/page.js\"\n'use client'\n\nimport { sendGTMEvent } from '@next/third-parties/google'\n\nexport function EventButton() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <button\n        onClick={() => sendGTMEvent('event', 'buttonClicked', { value: 'xyz' })}\n      >\n        Send Event\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n</AppOnly>\n\n<PagesOnly>\n\n```jsx filename=\"pages/index.js\"\nimport { sendGTMEvent } from '@next/third-parties/google'\n\nexport function EventButton() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <button\n        onClick={() => sendGTMEvent('event', 'buttonClicked', { value: 'xyz' })}\n      >\n        Send Event\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n</PagesOnly>\n\nRefer to the Tag Manager [developer\ndocumentation](https://developers.google.com/tag-platform/tag-manager/datalayer) to learn about the\ndifferent variables and events that can be passed into the function.\n\n#### Options\n\nOptions to pass to the Google Tag Manager.

By default, it fetches the original scripts after hydration occurs on the page.\n\n> **Recommendation**: If Google Tag Manager is already included in your application, you can\n> configure Google Analytics directly using it, rather than including Google Analytics as a separate\n> component. Refer to the\n> [documentation](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/ga4/tag-options#what-is-gtm)\n> to learn more about the differences between Tag Manager and `gtag.js`.\n\n<AppOnly>\n\nTo load Google Analytics for all routes, include the component directly in your root layout and pass\nin your measurement ID:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/layout.tsx\" switcher\nimport { GoogleAnalytics } from '@next/third-parties/google'\n\nexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <body>{children}</body>\n      <GoogleAnalytics gaId=\"G-XYZ\" />\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/layout.js\" switcher\nimport { GoogleAnalytics } from '@next/third-parties/google'\n\nexport default function RootLayout({ children }) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <body>{children}</body>\n      <GoogleAnalytics gaId=\"G-XYZ\" />\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n</AppOnly>\n\n<PagesOnly>\n\nTo load Google Analytics for all routes, include the component directly in your custom `_app` and\npass in your measurement ID:\n\n```jsx filename=\"pages/_app.js\"\nimport { GoogleAnalytics } from '@next/third-parties/google'\n\nexport default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Component {...pageProps} />\n      <GoogleAnalytics gaId=\"G-XYZ\" />\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n</PagesOnly>\n\nTo load Google Analytics for a single route, include the component in your page file:\n\n<AppOnly>\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/page.js\"\nimport { GoogleAnalytics } from '@next/third-parties/google'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return <GoogleAnalytics gaId=\"G-XYZ\" />\n}\n```\n\n</AppOnly>\n\n<PagesOnly>\n\n```jsx filename=\"pages/index.js\"\nimport { GoogleAnalytics } from '@next/third-parties/google'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return <GoogleAnalytics gaId=\"G-XYZ\" />\n}\n```\n\n</PagesOnly>\n\n#### Sending Events\n\nThe `sendGAEvent` function can be used to measure user interactions on your page by sending events\nusing the `dataLayer` object. For this function to work, the `<GoogleAnalytics />` component must be\nincluded in either a parent layout, page, or component, or directly in the same file.\n\n<AppOnly>\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/page.js\"\n'use client'\n\nimport { sendGAEvent } from '@next/third-parties/google'\n\nexport function EventButton() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <button\n        onClick={() => sendGAEvent('event', 'buttonClicked', { value: 'xyz' })}\n      >\n        Send Event\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n</AppOnly>\n\n<PagesOnly>\n\n```jsx filename=\"pages/index.js\"\nimport { sendGAEvent } from '@next/third-parties/google'\n\nexport function EventButton() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <button\n        onClick={() => sendGAEvent('event', 'buttonClicked', { value: 'xyz' })}\n      >\n        Send Event\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n</PagesOnly>\n\nRefer to the Google Analytics [developer\ndocumentation](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/ga4/event-parameters) to learn\nmore about event parameters.\n\n#### Tracking Pageviews\n\nGoogle Analytics automatically tracks pageviews when the browser history state changes. This means\nthat client-side navigations between Next.js routes will send pageview data without any configuration.\n\nTo ensure that client-side navigations are being measured correctly, verify that the [_“Enhanced\nMeasurement”_](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9216061#enable_disable) property is\nenabled in your Admin panel and the _“Page changes based on browser history events”_ checkbox is\nselected.\n\n> **Note**: If you decide to manually send pageview events, make sure to disable the default\n> pageview measurement to avoid having duplicate data. Refer to the Google Analytics [developer\n> documentation](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/ga4/views?client_type=gtag#manual_pageviews)\n> to learn more.\n\n#### Options\n\nOptions to pass to the `<GoogleAnalytics>` component.\n\n| Name            | Type     | Description                                                                                            |\n| --------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| `gaId`          | Required | Your [measurement ID](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/12270356).

Heap snapshots will also be taken automatically when memory usage gets close to the configured limit.\n\n> **Good to know**: This feature is not compatible with the Webpack build worker option which is auto-enabled unless you have custom webpack config.\n\n## Record a heap profile\n\nTo look for memory issues, you can record a heap profile from Node.js and load it in Chrome DevTools to identify potential sources of memory leaks.\n\nIn your terminal, pass the `--heap-prof` flag to Node.js when starting your Next.js build:\n\n```sh\nnode --heap-prof node_modules/next/dist/bin/next build\n```\n\nAt the end of the build, a `.heapprofile` file will be created by Node.js.\n\nIn Chrome DevTools, you can open the Memory tab and click on the \"Load Profile\" button to visualize the file.\n\n## Analyze a snapshot of the heap\n\nYou can use an inspector tool to analyze the memory usage of the application.\n\nWhen running the `next build` or `next dev` command, add `NODE_OPTIONS=--inspect` to the beginning of the command. This will expose the inspector agent on the default port.\nIf you wish to break before any user code starts, you can pass `--inspect-brk` instead. While the process is running, you can use a tool such as Chrome DevTools to connect to the debugging port to record and analyze a snapshot of the heap to see what memory is being retained.\n\nStarting in `14.2.0`, you can also run `next build` with the `--experimental-debug-memory-usage` flag to make it easier to take heap snapshots.\n\nWhile running in this mode, you can send a `SIGUSR2` signal to the process at any point, and the process will take a heap snapshot.\n\nThe heap snapshot will be saved to the project root of the Next.js application and can be loaded in any heap analyzer, such as Chrome DevTools, to see what memory is retained. This mode is not yet compatible with Webpack build workers.\n\nSee [how to record and analyze heap snapshots](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/memory-problems/heap-snapshots) for more information.\n\n## Webpack build worker\n\nThe Webpack build worker allows you to run Webpack compilations inside a separate Node.js worker which will decrease memory usage of your application during builds.\n\nThis option is enabled by default if your application does not have a custom Webpack configuration starting in `v14.1.0`.\n\nIf you are using an older version of Next.js or you have a custom Webpack configuration, you can enable this option by setting `experimental.webpackBuildWorker: true` inside your `next.config.js`.\n\n> **Good to know**: This feature may not be compatible with all custom Webpack plugins.\n\n## Disable Webpack cache\n\nThe [Webpack cache](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/cache/) saves generated Webpack modules in memory and/or to disk to improve the speed of builds. This can\nhelp with performance, but it will also increase the memory usage of your application to store the cached data.\n\nYou can disable this behavior by adding a [custom Webpack configuration](/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/webpack) to your application:\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.mjs\"\n/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */\nconst nextConfig = {\n  webpack: (\n    config,\n    { buildId, dev, isServer, defaultLoaders, nextRuntime, webpack }\n  ) => {\n    if (config.cache && !dev) {\n      config.cache = Object.freeze({\n        type: 'memory',\n      })\n      config.cache.maxMemoryGenerations = 0\n    }\n    // Important: return the modified config\n    return config\n  },\n}\n\nexport default nextConfig\n```\n\n## Disable source maps\n\nGenerating source maps consumes extra memory during the build process.\n\nYou can disable source map generation by adding `productionBrowserSourceMaps: false` and `experimental.serverSourceMaps: false` to your Next.js configuration.\n\n> **Good to know**: Some plugins may turn on source maps and may require custom configuration to disable.\n\n## Edge memory issues\n\nNext.js `v14.1.3` fixed a memory issue when using the Edge runtime. Please update to this version (or later) to see if it addresses your issue.\n"},{"path":"docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/06-optimizing/index.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/02-app/01-building-your-application/06-optimizing/index.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing","sha":"61f98715e1468a091fbaace15c18ae6eb5b9adbc","size":3091,"content":"---\ntitle: Optimizations\nnav_title: Optimizing\ndescription: Optimize your Next.js application for best performance and user experience.\n---\n\n{/* The content of this doc is shared between the app and pages router. You can use the `<PagesOnly>Content</PagesOnly>` component to add content that is specific to the Pages Router. Any shared content should not be wrapped in a component. */}\n\nNext.js comes with a variety of built-in optimizations designed to improve your application's speed and [Core Web Vitals](https://web.dev/vitals/). This guide will cover the optimizations you can leverage to enhance your user experience.\n\n## Built-in Components\n\nBuilt-in components abstract away the complexity of implementing common UI optimizations. These components are:\n\n- **Images**: Built on the native `<img>` element. The Image Component optimizes images for performance by lazy loading and automatically resizing images based on device size.\n- **Link**: Built on the native `<a>` tags. The Link Component prefetches pages in the background, for faster and smoother page transitions.\n- **Scripts**: Built on the native `<script>` tags. The Script Component gives you control over loading and execution of third-party scripts.\n\n## Metadata\n\nMetadata helps search engines understand your content better (which can result in better SEO), and allows you to customize how your content is presented on social media, helping you create a more engaging and consistent user experience across various platforms.\n\n<AppOnly>\n\nThe Metadata API in Next.js allows you to modify the `<head>` element of a page. You can configure metadata in two ways:\n\n- **Config-based Metadata**: Export a [static `metadata` object](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-metadata#metadata-object) or a dynamic [`generateMetadata` function](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-metadata#generatemetadata-function) in a `layout.js` or `page.js` file.\n- **File-based Metadata**: Add static or dynamically generated special files to route segments.\n\nAdditionally, you can create dynamic Open Graph Images using JSX and CSS with [imageResponse](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/image-response) constructor.\n\n</AppOnly>\n\n<PagesOnly>\n\nThe Head Component in Next.js allows you to modify the `<head>` of a page. Learn more in the [Head Component](/docs/pages/api-reference/components/head) documentation.\n\n</PagesOnly>\n\n## Static Assets\n\nNext.js `/public` folder can be used to serve static assets like images, fonts, and other files. Files inside `/public` can also be cached by CDN providers so that they are delivered efficiently.\n\n## Analytics and Monitoring\n\nFor large applications, Next.js integrates with popular analytics and monitoring tools to help you understand how your application is performing. Learn more in the <PagesOnly>[Analytics](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/analytics), </PagesOnly> [OpenTelemetry](/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/open-telemetry)<PagesOnly>,</PagesOnly> and [Instrumentation](/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/instrumentation) guides.\n"},{"path":"docs/02-app/02-api-reference/06-create-next-app.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/02-app/02-api-reference/06-create-next-app.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/create-next-app","sha":"90417390ce127c9260dfc07256635bb5d77d2966","size":4585,"content":"---\ntitle: create-next-app\ndescription: Create Next.js apps in one command with create-next-app.\n---\n\n{/* The content of this doc is shared between the app and pages router.

Any shared content should not be wrapped in a component. */}\n\nThe easiest way to get started with Next.js is by using `create-next-app`. This CLI tool enables you to quickly start building a new Next.js application, with everything set up for you.\n\nYou can create a new app using the default Next.js template, or by using one of the [official Next.js examples](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples).\n\n### Interactive\n\nYou can create a new project interactively by running:\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nnpx create-next-app@latest\n```\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nyarn create next-app\n```\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\npnpm create next-app\n```\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nbun create next-app\n```\n\nYou will then be asked the following prompts:\n\n```txt filename=\"Terminal\"\nWhat is your project named?  my-app\nWould you like to use TypeScript?  No / Yes\nWould you like to use ESLint?  No / Yes\nWould you like to use Tailwind CSS?  No / Yes\nWould you like your code inside a `src/` directory?  No / Yes\nWould you like to use App Router? (recommended)  No / Yes\nWould you like to use Turbopack for `next dev`?  No / Yes\nWould you like to customize the import alias (`@/*` by default)?  No / Yes\n```\n\nOnce you've answered the prompts, a new project will be created with the correct configuration depending on your answers.\n\n### Non-interactive\n\nYou can also pass command line arguments to set up a new project non-interactively.\n\nFurther, you can negate default options by prefixing them with `--no-` (e.g. `--no-eslint`).\n\nSee `create-next-app --help`:\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nUsage: create-next-app <project-directory> [options]\n\nOptions:\n  -V, --version                        output the version number\n  --ts, --typescript\n\n    Initialize as a TypeScript project. (default)\n\n  --js, --javascript\n\n    Initialize as a JavaScript project.\n\n  --tailwind\n\n    Initialize with Tailwind CSS config. (default)\n\n  --eslint\n\n    Initialize with ESLint config.\n\n  --app\n\n    Initialize as an App Router project.\n\n  --src-dir\n\n    Initialize inside a `src/` directory.\n\n  --turbo\n\n    Enable Turbopack by default for development.\n\n  --import-alias <alias-to-configure>\n\n    Specify import alias to use (default \"@/*\").\n\n  --empty\n\n    Initialize an empty project.\n\n  --use-npm\n\n    Explicitly tell the CLI to bootstrap the app using npm\n\n  --use-pnpm\n\n    Explicitly tell the CLI to bootstrap the app using pnpm\n\n  --use-yarn\n\n    Explicitly tell the CLI to bootstrap the app using Yarn\n\n  --use-bun\n\n    Explicitly tell the CLI to bootstrap the app using Bun\n\n  -e, --example [name]|[github-url]\n\n    An example to bootstrap the app with. You can use an example name\n    from the official Next.js repo or a public GitHub URL. The URL can use\n    any branch and/or subdirectory\n\n  --example-path <path-to-example>\n\n    In a rare case, your GitHub URL might contain a branch name with\n    a slash (e.g. bug/fix-1) and the path to the example (e.g. foo/bar).\n    In this case, you must specify the path to the example separately:\n    --example-path foo/bar\n\n  --reset-preferences\n\n    Explicitly tell the CLI to reset any stored preferences\n\n  --skip-install\n\n    Explicitly tell the CLI to skip installing packages\n\n  -h, --help                           output usage information\n```\n\n### Why use Create Next App?\n\n`create-next-app` allows you to create a new Next.js app within seconds. It is officially maintained by the creators of Next.js, and includes a number of benefits:\n\n- **Interactive Experience**: Running `npx create-next-app@latest` (with no arguments) launches an interactive experience that guides you through setting up a project.\n- **Zero Dependencies**: Initializing a project is as quick as one second. Create Next App has zero dependencies.\n- **Offline Support**: Create Next App will automatically detect if you're offline and bootstrap your project using your local package cache.\n- **Support for Examples**: Create Next App can bootstrap your application using an example from the Next.js examples collection (e.g. `npx create-next-app --example api-routes`) or any public GitHub repository.\n- **Tested**: The package is part of the Next.js monorepo and tested using the same integration test suite as Next.js itself, ensuring it works as expected with every release.\n"},{"path":"docs/02-app/02-api-reference/index.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/02-app/02-api-reference/index.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference","sha":"330fb069c6f72befe408d58e3a6e6daed029d4df","size":151,"content":"---\ntitle: API Reference\ndescription: Next.js API Reference for the App Router.\n---\n\nThe Next.js API reference is divided into the following sections:\n"},{"path":"docs/02-app/02-api-reference/08-next-cli.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/02-app/02-api-reference/08-next-cli.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-cli","sha":"e33a96e7648c42d45d7bdd1c0a48d251c05bb8e0","size":18496,"content":"---\ntitle: Next.js CLI\ndescription: Learn how the Next.js CLI allows you to develop, build, and start your application, and more.\n---\n\n{/* The content of this doc is shared between the app and pages router.

Includes sensitive data.\n  -h, --help                               Displays this message.\n```\n\nThe application will start at `http://localhost:3000` by default. The default port can be changed with `-p`, like so:\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nnext dev -p 4000\n```\n\nOr using the `PORT` environment variable:\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nPORT=4000 next dev\n```\n\n> **Good to know**:\n>\n> - `PORT` cannot be set in `.env` as booting up the HTTP server happens before any other code is initialized.\n> - Next.js will automatically retry with another port until a port is available if a port is not specified with the CLI option `--port` or the `PORT` environment variable.\n\nYou can also set the hostname to be different from the default of `0.0.0.0`, this can be useful for making the application available for other devices on the network. The default hostname can be changed with `-H`, like so:\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nnext dev -H 192.168.1.2\n```\n\n### Turbopack\n\n[Turbopack](/docs/architecture/turbopack) (beta), our new bundler, which is being tested and stabilized in Next.js, helps speed up local iterations while working on your application.\n\nTo use Turbopack in development mode, add the `--turbo` option:\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nnext dev --turbo\n```\n\n### HTTPS for Local Development\n\nFor certain use cases like webhooks or authentication, it may be required to use HTTPS to have a secure environment on `localhost`. Next.js can generate a self-signed certificate with `next dev` as follows:\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nnext dev --experimental-https\n```\n\nYou can also provide a custom certificate and key with `--experimental-https-key` and `--experimental-https-cert`. Optionally, you can provide a custom CA certificate with `--experimental-https-ca` as well.\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nnext dev --experimental-https --experimental-https-key ./certificates/localhost-key.pem --experimental-https-cert ./certificates/localhost.pem\n```\n\n`next dev --experimental-https` is only intended for development and creates a locally-trusted certificate with `mkcert`. In production, use properly issued certificates from trusted authorities. When deploying to Vercel, HTTPS is [automatically configured](https://vercel.com/docs/security/encryption) for your Next.js application.\n\n## Build\n\n`next build` creates an optimized production build of your application. The output displays information about each route:\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nRoute (app)                               Size     First Load JS\n┌ ○ /                                     5.3 kB         89.5 kB\n├ ○ /_not-found                           885 B          85.1 kB\n└ ○ /about                                137 B          84.4 kB\n+ First Load JS shared by all             84.2 kB\n  ├ chunks/184-d3bb186aac44da98.js        28.9 kB\n  ├ chunks/30b509c0-f3503c24f98f3936.js   53.4 kB\n  └ other shared chunks (total)\n\n\n○  (Static)  prerendered as static content\n```\n\n- **Size**: The number of assets downloaded when navigating to the page client-side. The size for each route only includes its dependencies.\n- **First Load JS**: The number of assets downloaded when visiting the page from the server. The amount of JS shared by all is shown as a separate metric.\n\nBoth of these values are [**compressed with gzip**](/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/compress). The first load is indicated by green, yellow, or red. Aim for green for performant applications.\n\nTo get a list of the available options with `next build`, run the following command inside your project directory:\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nnext build -h\n```\n\nThe output should look like this:\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nUsage: next build [directory] [options]\n\nCreates an optimized production build of your application. The output displays information\nabout each route.\n\nArguments:\n  [directory]                       A directory on which to build the application. If no\n                                    provided, the current directory will be\n                                    used.\n\nOptions:\n  -d, --debug                       Enables a more verbose build output.\n  --profile                         Enables production profiling for React.\n  --no-lint                         Disables linting.\n  --no-mangling                     Disables mangling.\n  --experimental-app-only           Builds only App Router routes.\n  --experimental-build-mode [mode]  Uses an experimental build mode. (choices: \"compile\"\n                                    \"generate\", default: \"default\")\n  -h, --help                        Displays this message.\n```\n\n### Debug\n\nYou can enable more verbose build output with the `--debug` flag in `next build`.\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nnext build --debug\n```\n\nWith this flag enabled additional build output like rewrites, redirects, and headers will be shown.\n\n### Linting\n\nYou can disable linting for builds like so:\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nnext build --no-lint\n```\n\n### Mangling\n\nYou can disable [mangling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_mangling) for builds like so:\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nnext build --no-mangling\n```\n\n> **Good to know**: This may affect performance and should only be used for debugging purposes.\n\n### Profiling\n\nYou can enable production profiling for React with the `--profile` flag in `next build`.\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nnext build --profile\n```\n\nAfter that, you can use the profiler in the same way as you would in development.\n\n## Production\n\n`next start` starts the application in production mode. The application should be compiled with [`next build`](#build) first.\n\nTo get a list of the available options with `next start`, run the follow command inside your project directory:\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nnext start -h\n```\n\nThe output should look like this:\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nUsage: next start [directory] [options]\n\nStarts Next.js in production mode. The application should be compiled with `next build`\nfirst.\n\nArguments:\n  [directory]                           A directory on which to start the application.\n                                        If not directory is provided, the current\n                                        directory will be used.\n\nOptions:\n  -p, --port <port>                     Specify a port number on which to start the\n                                        application. (default: 3000, env: PORT)\n  -H, --hostname <hostname>             Specify a hostname on which to start the\n                                        application (default: 0.0.0.0).\n  --keepAliveTimeout <keepAliveTimeout> Specify the maximum amount of milliseconds to wait\n                                        before closing the inactive connections.\n  -h, --help                            Displays this message.\n```\n\nThe application will start at `http://localhost:3000` by default. The default port can be changed with `-p`, like so:\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nnext start -p 4000\n```\n\nOr using the `PORT` environment variable:\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nPORT=4000 next start\n```\n\n> **Good to know**:\n>\n> - `PORT` cannot be set in `.env` as booting up the HTTP server happens before any other code is initialized.\n> - `next start` cannot be used with `output: 'standalone'` or `output: 'export'`.\n\n### Keep Alive Timeout\n\nWhen deploying Next.js behind a downstream proxy (e.g. a load-balancer like AWS ELB/ALB) it's important to configure Next's underlying HTTP server with [keep-alive timeouts](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_server_keepalivetimeout) that are _larger_ than the downstream proxy's timeouts. Otherwise, once a keep-alive timeout is reached for a given TCP connection, Node.js will immediately terminate that connection without notifying the downstream proxy. This results in a proxy error whenever it attempts to reuse a connection that Node.js has already terminated.\n\nTo configure the timeout values for the production Next.js server, pass `--keepAliveTimeout` (in milliseconds) to `next start`, like so:\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nnext start --keepAliveTimeout 70000\n```\n\n## Info\n\n`next info` prints relevant details about the current system which can be used to report Next.js bugs.\nThis information includes Operating System platform/arch/version, Binaries (Node.js, npm, Yarn, pnpm) and npm package versions (`next`, `react`, `react-dom`).\n\nTo get a list of the available options with `next info`, run the following command inside your project directory:\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nnext info -h\n```\n\nThe output should look like this:\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nUsage: next info [options]\n\nPrints relevant details about the current system which can be used to report Next.js bugs.\n\nOptions:\n  --verbose   Collections additional information for debugging.\n  -h, --help  Displays this message.\n```\n\nRunning `next info` will give you information like this example:\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\n\nOperating System:\n  Platform: linux\n  Arch: x64\n  Version: #22-Ubuntu SMP Fri Nov 5 13:21:36 UTC 2021\n  Available memory (MB): 31795\n  Available CPU cores: 16\nBinaries:\n  Node: 16.13.0\n  npm: 8.1.0\n  Yarn: 1.22.17\n  pnpm: 6.24.2\nRelevant Packages:\n  next: 14.1.1-canary.61 // Latest available version is detected (14.1.1-canary.61).\n  react: 18.2.0\n  react-dom: 18.2.0\nNext.js Config:\n  output: N/A\n\n```\n\nThis information should then be pasted into GitHub Issues.\n\nYou can also run `next info --verbose` which will print additional information about the system and the installation of packages related to `next`.\n\n## Lint\n\n`next lint` runs ESLint for all files in the `pages/`, `app/`, `components/`, `lib/`, and `src/` directories. It also\nprovides a guided setup to install any required dependencies if ESLint is not already configured in\nyour application.\n\nTo get a list of the available options with `next lint`, run the following command inside your project directory:\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nnext lint -h\n```\n\nThe output should look like this:\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nUsage: next lint [directory] [options]\n\nRuns ESLint for all files in the `/src`, `/app`, `/pages`, `/components`, and `/lib` directories. It also\nprovides a guided setup to install any required dependencies if ESLint is not already configured in your\napplication.\n\nArguments:\n  [directory]                                         A base directory on which to lint the application.\n                                                      If no directory is provided, the current directory\n                                                      will be used.\n\nOptions:\n  -d, --dir, <dirs...>                                Include directory, or directories, to run ESLint.\n  --file, <files...>                                  Include file, or files, to run ESLint.\n  --ext, [exts...]                                    Specify JavaScript file extensions.

With this extension, `cache` indicates how a _server-side_ fetch request will interact with the framework's persistent HTTP cache.\n\nYou can call `fetch` with `async` and `await` directly within Server Components.\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/page.tsx\" switcher\nexport default async function Page() {\n  // This request should be cached until manually invalidated.\n  // Similar to `getStaticProps`.\n  // `force-cache` is the default and can be omitted.\n  const staticData = await fetch(`https://...`, { cache: 'force-cache' })\n\n  // This request should be refetched on every request.\n  // Similar to `getServerSideProps`.\n  const dynamicData = await fetch(`https://...`, { cache: 'no-store' })\n\n  // This request should be cached with a lifetime of 10 seconds.\n  // Similar to `getStaticProps` with the `revalidate` option.\n  const revalidatedData = await fetch(`https://...`, {\n    next: { revalidate: 10 },\n  })\n\n  return <div>...</div>\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/page.js\" switcher\nexport default async function Page() {\n  // This request should be cached until manually invalidated.\n  // Similar to `getStaticProps`.\n  // `force-cache` is the default and can be omitted.\n  const staticData = await fetch(`https://...`, { cache: 'force-cache' })\n\n  // This request should be refetched on every request.\n  // Similar to `getServerSideProps`.\n  const dynamicData = await fetch(`https://...`, { cache: 'no-store' })\n\n  // This request should be cached with a lifetime of 10 seconds.\n  // Similar to `getStaticProps` with the `revalidate` option.\n  const revalidatedData = await fetch(`https://...`, {\n    next: { revalidate: 10 },\n  })\n\n  return <div>...</div>\n}\n```\n\n## `fetch(url, options)`\n\nSince Next.js extends the [Web `fetch()` API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API), you can use any of the [native options available](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/fetch#parameters).\n\n### `options.cache`\n\nConfigure how the request should interact with Next.js [Data Cache](/docs/app/building-your-application/caching#data-cache).\n\n```ts\nfetch(`https://...`, { cache: 'force-cache' | 'no-store' })\n```\n\n- **`no-store`** (default): Next.js fetches the resource from the remote server on every request without looking in the cache, and it will not update the cache with the downloaded resource.\n- **`force-cache`**: Next.js looks for a matching request in its Data Cache.\n  - If there is a match and it is fresh, it will be returned from the cache.\n  - If there is no match or a stale match, Next.js will fetch the resource from the remote server and update the cache with the downloaded resource.\n\n> **Good to know**: The `no-cache` option behaves the same way as `no-store` in Next.js.\n\n### `options.next.revalidate`\n\n```ts\nfetch(`https://...`, { next: { revalidate: false | 0 | number } })\n```\n\nSet the cache lifetime of a resource (in seconds).\n\n- **`false`** - Cache the resource indefinitely. Semantically equivalent to `revalidate: Infinity`. The HTTP cache may evict older resources over time.\n- **`0`** - Prevent the resource from being cached.\n- **`number`** - (in seconds) Specify the resource should have a cache lifetime of at most `n` seconds.\n\n> **Good to know**:\n>\n> - If an individual `fetch()` request sets a `revalidate` number lower than the [default `revalidate`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/route-segment-config#revalidate) of a route, the whole route revalidation interval will be decreased.\n> - If two fetch requests with the same URL in the same route have different `revalidate` values, the lower value will be used.\n> - As a convenience, it is not necessary to set the `cache` option if `revalidate` is set to a number.\n> - Conflicting options such as `{ revalidate: 3600, cache: 'no-store' }` will cause an error.\n\n### `options.next.tags`\n\n```ts\nfetch(`https://...`, { next: { tags: ['collection'] } })\n```\n\nSet the cache tags of a resource. Data can then be revalidated on-demand using [`revalidateTag`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/revalidateTag). The max length for a custom tag is 256 characters and the max tag items is 64.\n\n## Version History\n\n| Version   | Changes                                                                 |\n| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `v15.0.0` | Default `cache` option was changed from `'force-cache'` to `'no-store'` |\n| `v13.0.0` | `fetch` introduced.                                                     |\n"},{"path":"docs/02-app/02-api-reference/04-functions/generate-viewport.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/02-app/02-api-reference/04-functions/generate-viewport.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-viewport","sha":"b5761ffa6de136aa68c431e4e0ad35c54cb679b5","size":6147,"content":"---\ntitle: generateViewport\ndescription: API Reference for the generateViewport function.\nrelated:\n  title: Next Steps\n  description: View all the Metadata API options.\n  links:\n    - app/api-reference/file-conventions/metadata\n    - app/building-your-application/optimizing/metadata\n---\n\nYou can customize the initial viewport of the page with the static `viewport` object or the dynamic `generateViewport` function.\n\n> **Good to know**:\n>\n> - The `viewport` object and `generateViewport` function exports are **only supported in Server Components**.\n> - You cannot export both the `viewport` object and `generateViewport` function from the same route segment.\n> - If you're coming from migrating `metadata` exports, you can use [metadata-to-viewport-export codemod](/docs/app/building-your-application/upgrading/codemods#metadata-to-viewport-export) to update your changes.\n\n## The `viewport` object\n\nTo define the viewport options, export a `viewport` object from a `layout.jsx` or `page.jsx` file.\n\n```tsx filename=\"layout.tsx | page.tsx\" switcher\nimport type { Viewport } from 'next'\n\nexport const viewport: Viewport = {\n  themeColor: 'black',\n}\n\nexport default function Page() {}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"layout.jsx | page.jsx\" switcher\nexport const viewport = {\n  themeColor: 'black',\n}\n\nexport default function Page() {}\n```\n\n## `generateViewport` function\n\n`generateViewport` should return a [`Viewport` object](#viewport-fields) containing one or more viewport fields.\n\n```tsx filename=\"layout.tsx | page.tsx\" switcher\nexport function generateViewport({ params }) {\n  return {\n    themeColor: '...',\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"layout.js | page.js\" switcher\nexport function generateViewport({ params }) {\n  return {\n    themeColor: '...',\n  }\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know**:\n>\n> - If the viewport doesn't depend on runtime information, it should be defined using the static [`viewport` object](#the-viewport-object) rather than `generateViewport`.\n\n## Viewport Fields\n\n### `themeColor`\n\nLearn more about [`theme-color`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta/name/theme-color).\n\n**Simple theme color**\n\n```tsx filename=\"layout.tsx | page.tsx\" switcher\nimport type { Viewport } from 'next'\n\nexport const viewport: Viewport = {\n  themeColor: 'black',\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"layout.jsx | page.jsx\" switcher\nexport const viewport = {\n  themeColor: 'black',\n}\n```\n\n```html filename=\"<head> output\" hideLineNumbers\n<meta name=\"theme-color\" content=\"black\" />\n```\n\n**With media attribute**\n\n```tsx filename=\"layout.tsx | page.tsx\" switcher\nimport type { Viewport } from 'next'\n\nexport const viewport: Viewport = {\n  themeColor: [\n    { media: '(prefers-color-scheme: light)', color: 'cyan' },\n    { media: '(prefers-color-scheme: dark)', color: 'black' },\n  ],\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"layout.jsx | page.jsx\" switcher\nexport const viewport = {\n  themeColor: [\n    { media: '(prefers-color-scheme: light)', color: 'cyan' },\n    { media: '(prefers-color-scheme: dark)', color: 'black' },\n  ],\n}\n```\n\n```html filename=\"<head> output\" hideLineNumbers\n<meta name=\"theme-color\" media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" content=\"cyan\" />\n<meta name=\"theme-color\" media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" content=\"black\" />\n```\n\n### `width`, `initialScale`, `maximumScale` and `userScalable`\n\n> **Good to know**: The `viewport` meta tag is automatically set, and manual configuration is usually unnecessary as the default is sufficient.

For example, you can use the `request.nextUrl` property to get the current URL, and then modify it to redirect to a different URL.\n\n```ts\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n\n// Given an incoming request...\nconst loginUrl = new URL('/login', request.url)\n// Add ?from=/incoming-url to the /login URL\nloginUrl.searchParams.set('from', request.nextUrl.pathname)\n// And redirect to the new URL\nreturn NextResponse.redirect(loginUrl)\n```\n\n## `rewrite()`\n\nProduce a response that rewrites (proxies) the given [URL](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/URL) while preserving the original URL.\n\n```ts\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n\n// Incoming request: /about, browser shows /about\n// Rewritten request: /proxy, browser shows /about\nreturn NextResponse.rewrite(new URL('/proxy', request.url))\n```\n\n## `next()`\n\nThe `next()` method is useful for Middleware, as it allows you to return early and continue routing.\n\n```ts\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n\nreturn NextResponse.next()\n```\n\nYou can also forward `headers` when producing the response:\n\n```ts\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n\n// Given an incoming request...\nconst newHeaders = new Headers(request.headers)\n// Add a new header\nnewHeaders.set('x-version', '123')\n// And produce a response with the new headers\nreturn NextResponse.next({\n  request: {\n    // New request headers\n    headers: newHeaders,\n  },\n})\n```\n"},{"path":"docs/02-app/02-api-reference/04-functions/revalidatePath.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/02-app/02-api-reference/04-functions/revalidatePath.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/revalidatePath","sha":"4867ad80598c2e42d1cca02e03581434ec9cb713","size":4281,"content":"---\ntitle: revalidatePath\ndescription: API Reference for the revalidatePath function.\n---\n\n`revalidatePath` allows you to purge [cached data](/docs/app/building-your-application/caching) on-demand for a specific path.\n\n> **Good to know**:\n>\n> - `revalidatePath` is available in both [Node.js and Edge runtimes](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/edge-and-nodejs-runtimes).\n> - `revalidatePath` only invalidates the cache when the included path is next visited.

Must be less than 1024 characters. This value is case-sensitive.\n- `type`: (optional) `'page'` or `'layout'` string to change the type of path to revalidate. If `path` contains a dynamic segment (for example, `/product/[slug]/page`), this parameter is required. If path refers to the literal route segment, e.g., `/product/1` for a dynamic page (e.g., `/product/[slug]/page`), you should not provide `type`.\n\n## Returns\n\n`revalidatePath` does not return a value.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Revalidating A Specific URL\n\n```ts\nimport { revalidatePath } from 'next/cache'\nrevalidatePath('/blog/post-1')\n```\n\nThis will revalidate one specific URL on the next page visit.\n\n### Revalidating A Page Path\n\n```ts\nimport { revalidatePath } from 'next/cache'\nrevalidatePath('/blog/[slug]', 'page')\n// or with route groups\nrevalidatePath('/(main)/post/[slug]', 'page')\n```\n\nThis will revalidate any URL that matches the provided `page` file on the next page visit. This will _not_ invalidate pages beneath the specific page. For example, `/blog/[slug]` won't invalidate `/blog/[slug]/[author]`.\n\n### Revalidating A Layout Path\n\n```ts\nimport { revalidatePath } from 'next/cache'\nrevalidatePath('/blog/[slug]', 'layout')\n// or with route groups\nrevalidatePath('/(main)/post/[slug]', 'layout')\n```\n\nThis will revalidate any URL that matches the provided `layout` file on the next page visit. This will cause pages beneath with the same layout to revalidate on the next visit. For example, in the above case, `/blog/[slug]/[another]` would also revalidate on the next visit.\n\n### Revalidating All Data\n\n```ts\nimport { revalidatePath } from 'next/cache'\n\nrevalidatePath('/', 'layout')\n```\n\nThis will purge the Client-side Router Cache, and revalidate the Data Cache on the next page visit.\n\n### Server Action\n\n```ts filename=\"app/actions.ts\" switcher\n'use server'\n\nimport { revalidatePath } from 'next/cache'\n\nexport default async function submit() {\n  await submitForm()\n  revalidatePath('/')\n}\n```\n\n### Route Handler\n\n```ts filename=\"app/api/revalidate/route.ts\" switcher\nimport { revalidatePath } from 'next/cache'\nimport type { NextRequest } from 'next/server'\n\nexport async function GET(request: NextRequest) {\n  const path = request.nextUrl.searchParams.get('path')\n\n  if (path) {\n    revalidatePath(path)\n    return Response.json({ revalidated: true, now: Date.now() })\n  }\n\n  return Response.json({\n    revalidated: false,\n    now: Date.now(),\n    message: 'Missing path to revalidate',\n  })\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"app/api/revalidate/route.js\" switcher\nimport { revalidatePath } from 'next/cache'\n\nexport async function GET(request) {\n  const path = request.nextUrl.searchParams.get('path')\n\n  if (path) {\n    revalidatePath(path)\n    return Response.json({ revalidated: true, now: Date.now() })\n  }\n\n  return Response.json({\n    revalidated: false,\n    now: Date.now(),\n    message: 'Missing path to revalidate',\n  })\n}\n```\n"},{"path":"docs/02-app/02-api-reference/04-functions/revalidateTag.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/02-app/02-api-reference/04-functions/revalidateTag.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/revalidateTag","sha":"729e773b8f5e482fc688a18abf059b261de6afca","size":2074,"content":"---\ntitle: revalidateTag\ndescription: API Reference for the revalidateTag function.\n---\n\n`revalidateTag` allows you to purge [cached data](/docs/app/building-your-application/caching) on-demand for a specific cache tag.\n\n> **Good to know**:\n>\n> - `revalidateTag` is available in both [Node.js and Edge runtimes](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/edge-and-nodejs-runtimes).\n> - `revalidateTag` only invalidates the cache when the path is next visited.

For example:\n\n| URL                 | Returned value        |\n| ------------------- | --------------------- |\n| `/`                 | `'/'`                 |\n| `/dashboard`        | `'/dashboard'`        |\n| `/dashboard?v=2`    | `'/dashboard'`        |\n| `/blog/hello-world` | `'/blog/hello-world'` |\n\n## Examples\n\n### Do something in response to a route change\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/example-client-component.tsx\" switcher\n'use client'\n\nimport { usePathname, useSearchParams } from 'next/navigation'\n\nfunction ExampleClientComponent() {\n  const pathname = usePathname()\n  const searchParams = useSearchParams()\n  useEffect(() => {\n    // Do something here...\n  }, [pathname, searchParams])\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/example-client-component.js\" switcher\n'use client'\n\nimport { usePathname, useSearchParams } from 'next/navigation'\n\nfunction ExampleClientComponent() {\n  const pathname = usePathname()\n  const searchParams = useSearchParams()\n  useEffect(() => {\n    // Do something here...\n  }, [pathname, searchParams])\n}\n```\n\n| Version   | Changes                   |\n| --------- | ------------------------- |\n| `v13.0.0` | `usePathname` introduced. |\n"},{"path":"docs/02-app/02-api-reference/04-functions/unstable_rethrow.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/02-app/02-api-reference/04-functions/unstable_rethrow.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/unstable_rethrow","sha":"5cc4f1e25f4149607b94fa0d25143d52a5aa5fd8","size":2463,"content":"---\ntitle: unstable_rethrow\ndescription: API Reference for the unstable_rethrow function.\n---\n\n`unstable_rethrow` can be used to avoid catching internal errors thrown by Next.js when attempting to handle errors thrown from your own application.\n\nFor example, given the following code:\n\n```jsx\nimport { notFound } from 'next/navigation'\n\nexport default async function Component() {\n  try {\n    notFound()\n    await getData()\n  } catch (err) {\n    console.error(err)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this scenario, `console.error` will pick up the error thrown by `notFound`, which won't be useful for logging and will prevent\nthe `not-found.js` page from rendering.

The `null` value is for compatibility during migration since search params cannot be known during pre-rendering of a page that doesn't use `getServerSideProps`\n\n### Static Rendering\n\nIf a route is [statically rendered](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components#static-rendering-default), calling `useSearchParams` will cause the Client Component tree up to the closest [`Suspense` boundary](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/loading-ui-and-streaming#example) to be client-side rendered.\n\nThis allows a part of the route to be statically rendered while the dynamic part that uses `useSearchParams` is client-side rendered.\n\nWe recommend wrapping the Client Component that uses `useSearchParams` in a `<Suspense/>` boundary. This will allow any Client Components above it to be statically rendered and sent as part of initial HTML. [Example](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-search-params#static-rendering).\n\nFor example:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/dashboard/search-bar.tsx\" switcher\n'use client'\n\nimport { useSearchParams } from 'next/navigation'\n\nexport default function SearchBar() {\n  const searchParams = useSearchParams()\n\n  const search = searchParams.get('search')\n\n  // This will not be logged on the server when using static rendering\n  console.log(search)\n\n  return <>Search: {search}</>\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/dashboard/search-bar.js\" switcher\n'use client'\n\nimport { useSearchParams } from 'next/navigation'\n\nexport default function SearchBar() {\n  const searchParams = useSearchParams()\n\n  const search = searchParams.get('search')\n\n  // This will not be logged on the server when using static rendering\n  console.log(search)\n\n  return <>Search: {search}</>\n}\n```\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/dashboard/page.tsx\" switcher\nimport { Suspense } from 'react'\nimport SearchBar from './search-bar'\n\n// This component passed as a fallback to the Suspense boundary\n// will be rendered in place of the search bar in the initial HTML.\n// When the value is available during React hydration the fallback\n// will be replaced with the `<SearchBar>` component.\nfunction SearchBarFallback() {\n  return <>placeholder</>\n}\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <nav>\n        <Suspense fallback={<SearchBarFallback />}>\n          <SearchBar />\n        </Suspense>\n      </nav>\n      <h1>Dashboard</h1>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/dashboard/page.js\" switcher\nimport { Suspense } from 'react'\nimport SearchBar from './search-bar'\n\n// This component passed as a fallback to the Suspense boundary\n// will be rendered in place of the search bar in the initial HTML.\n// When the value is available during React hydration the fallback\n// will be replaced with the `<SearchBar>` component.\nfunction SearchBarFallback() {\n  return <>placeholder</>\n}\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <nav>\n        <Suspense fallback={<SearchBarFallback />}>\n          <SearchBar />\n        </Suspense>\n      </nav>\n      <h1>Dashboard</h1>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n## Behavior\n\n### Dynamic Rendering\n\nIf a route is [dynamically rendered](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components#dynamic-rendering), `useSearchParams` will be available on the server during the initial server render of the Client Component.\n\nFor example:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/dashboard/search-bar.tsx\" switcher\n'use client'\n\nimport { useSearchParams } from 'next/navigation'\n\nexport default function SearchBar() {\n  const searchParams = useSearchParams()\n\n  const search = searchParams.get('search')\n\n  // This will be logged on the server during the initial render\n  // and on the client on subsequent navigations.\n  console.log(search)\n\n  return <>Search: {search}</>\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/dashboard/search-bar.js\" switcher\n'use client'\n\nimport { useSearchParams } from 'next/navigation'\n\nexport default function SearchBar() {\n  const searchParams = useSearchParams()\n\n  const search = searchParams.get('search')\n\n  // This will be logged on the server during the initial render\n  // and on the client on subsequent navigations.\n  console.log(search)\n\n  return <>Search: {search}</>\n}\n```\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/dashboard/page.tsx\" switcher\nimport SearchBar from './search-bar'\n\nexport const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <nav>\n        <SearchBar />\n      </nav>\n      <h1>Dashboard</h1>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/dashboard/page.js\" switcher\nimport SearchBar from './search-bar'\n\nexport const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <nav>\n        <SearchBar />\n      </nav>\n      <h1>Dashboard</h1>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know**: Setting the [`dynamic` route segment config option](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/route-segment-config#dynamic) to `force-dynamic` can be used to force dynamic rendering.\n\n### Server Components\n\n#### Pages\n\nTo access search params in [Pages](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/page) (Server Components), use the [`searchParams`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/page#searchparams-optional) prop.\n\n#### Layouts\n\nUnlike Pages, [Layouts](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/layout) (Server Components) **do not** receive the `searchParams` prop. This is because a shared layout is [not re-rendered during navigation](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/linking-and-navigating#4-partial-rendering) which could lead to stale `searchParams` between navigations. View [detailed explanation](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/layout#layouts-do-not-receive-searchparams).\n\nInstead, use the Page [`searchParams`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/page) prop or the [`useSearchParams`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-search-params) hook in a Client Component, which is re-rendered on the client with the latest `searchParams`.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Updating `searchParams`\n\nYou can use [`useRouter`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-router) or [`Link`](/docs/app/api-reference/components/link) to set new `searchParams`.

Possible values include names of [Web Vitals](#web-vitals) metrics (TTFB, FCP, LCP, FID, CLS) specific to a web application.\n- `delta`: The difference between the current value and the previous value of the metric. The value is typically in milliseconds and represents the change in the metric's value over time.\n- `entries`: An array of [Performance Entries](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/PerformanceEntry) associated with the metric. These entries provide detailed information about the performance events related to the metric.\n- `navigationType`: Indicates the [type of navigation](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/PerformanceNavigationTiming/type) that triggered the metric collection. Possible values include `\"navigate\"`, `\"reload\"`, `\"back_forward\"`, and `\"prerender\"`.\n- `rating`: A qualitative rating of the metric value, providing an assessment of the performance. Possible values are `\"good\"`, `\"needs-improvement\"`, and `\"poor\"`. The rating is typically determined by comparing the metric value against predefined thresholds that indicate acceptable or suboptimal performance.\n- `value`: The actual value or duration of the performance entry, typically in milliseconds. The value provides a quantitative measure of the performance aspect being tracked by the metric. The source of the value depends on the specific metric being measured and can come from various [Performance API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Performance_API)s.\n\n## Web Vitals\n\n[Web Vitals](https://web.dev/vitals/) are a set of useful metrics that aim to capture the user\nexperience of a web page. The following web vitals are all included:\n\n- [Time to First Byte](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Glossary/Time_to_first_byte) (TTFB)\n- [First Contentful Paint](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Glossary/First_contentful_paint) (FCP)\n- [Largest Contentful Paint](https://web.dev/lcp/) (LCP)\n- [First Input Delay](https://web.dev/fid/) (FID)\n- [Cumulative Layout Shift](https://web.dev/cls/) (CLS)\n- [Interaction to Next Paint](https://web.dev/inp/) (INP)\n\nYou can handle all the results of these metrics using the `name` property.\n\n<PagesOnly>\n\n```jsx filename=\"pages/_app.js\"\nimport { useReportWebVitals } from 'next/web-vitals'\n\nfunction MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {\n  useReportWebVitals((metric) => {\n    switch (metric.name) {\n      case 'FCP': {\n        // handle FCP results\n      }\n      case 'LCP': {\n        // handle LCP results\n      }\n      // ...\n    }\n  })\n\n  return <Component {...pageProps} />\n}\n```\n\n</PagesOnly>\n\n<AppOnly>\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/components/web-vitals.tsx\" switcher\n'use client'\n\nimport { useReportWebVitals } from 'next/web-vitals'\n\nexport function WebVitals() {\n  useReportWebVitals((metric) => {\n    switch (metric.name) {\n      case 'FCP': {\n        // handle FCP results\n      }\n      case 'LCP': {\n        // handle LCP results\n      }\n      // ...\n    }\n  })\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/components/web-vitals.js\" switcher\n'use client'\n\nimport { useReportWebVitals } from 'next/web-vitals'\n\nexport function WebVitals() {\n  useReportWebVitals((metric) => {\n    switch (metric.name) {\n      case 'FCP': {\n        // handle FCP results\n      }\n      case 'LCP': {\n        // handle LCP results\n      }\n      // ...\n    }\n  })\n}\n```\n\n</AppOnly>\n\n<PagesOnly>\n\n## Custom Metrics\n\nIn addition to the core metrics listed above, there are some additional custom metrics that\nmeasure the time it takes for the page to hydrate and render:\n\n- `Next.js-hydration`: Length of time it takes for the page to start and finish hydrating (in ms)\n- `Next.js-route-change-to-render`: Length of time it takes for a page to start rendering after a\n  route change (in ms)\n- `Next.js-render`: Length of time it takes for a page to finish render after a route change (in ms)\n\nYou can handle all the results of these metrics separately:\n\n```jsx filename=\"pages/_app.js\"\nimport { useReportWebVitals } from 'next/web-vitals'\n\nfunction MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {\n  useReportWebVitals((metric) => {\n    switch (metric.name) {\n      case 'Next.js-hydration':\n        // handle hydration results\n        break\n      case 'Next.js-route-change-to-render':\n        // handle route-change to render results\n        break\n      case 'Next.js-render':\n        // handle render results\n        break\n      default:\n        break\n    }\n  })\n\n  return <Component {...pageProps} />\n}\n```\n\nThese metrics work in all browsers that support the [User Timing API](https://caniuse.com/#feat=user-timing).\n\n</PagesOnly>\n\n## Usage on Vercel\n\n[Vercel Speed Insights](https://vercel.com/docs/speed-insights/quickstart) does not `useReportWebVitals`, but `@vercel/speed-insights` package instead.\n`useReportWebVitals` hook is useful in local development, or if you're using a different service for collecting Web Vitals.\n\n## Sending results to external systems\n\nYou can send results to any endpoint to measure and track\nreal user performance on your site. For example:\n\n```js\nuseReportWebVitals((metric) => {\n  const body = JSON.stringify(metric)\n  const url = 'https://example.com/analytics'\n\n  // Use `navigator.sendBeacon()` if available, falling back to `fetch()`.\n  if (navigator.sendBeacon) {\n    navigator.sendBeacon(url, body)\n  } else {\n    fetch(url, { body, method: 'POST', keepalive: true })\n  }\n})\n```\n\n> **Good to know**: If you use [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/), using the\n> `id` value can allow you to construct metric distributions manually (to calculate percentiles,\n> etc.)\n\n> ```js\n> useReportWebVitals(metric => {\n>   // Use `window.gtag` if you initialized Google Analytics as this example:\n>   // https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/examples/with-google-analytics/pages/_app.js\n>   window.gtag('event', metric.name, {\n>     value: Math.round(metric.name === 'CLS' ? metric.value * 1000 : metric.value), // values must be integers\n>     event_label: metric.id, // id unique to current page load\n>     non_interaction: true, // avoids affecting bounce rate.\n>   });\n> }\n> ```\n>\n> Read more about [sending results to Google Analytics](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/web-vitals#send-the-results-to-google-analytics).\n"},{"path":"docs/02-app/02-api-reference/04-functions/generate-image-metadata.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/02-app/02-api-reference/04-functions/generate-image-metadata.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-image-metadata","sha":"f9b43525f9c8e79240e1379a419f2c04740d71f1","size":5644,"content":"---\ntitle: generateImageMetadata\ndescription: Learn how to generate multiple images in a single Metadata API special file.\nrelated:\n  title: Next Steps\n  description: View all the Metadata API options.\n  links:\n    - app/api-reference/file-conventions/metadata\n    - app/building-your-application/optimizing/metadata\n---\n\nYou can use `generateImageMetadata` to generate different versions of one image or return multiple images for one route segment.

useRouter\ndescription: API reference for the useRouter hook.\n---\n\nThe `useRouter` hook allows you to programmatically change routes inside [Client Components](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/client-components).\n\n> **Recommendation:** Use the [`<Link>` component](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/linking-and-navigating#link-component) for navigation unless you have a specific requirement for using `useRouter`.\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/example-client-component.tsx\" switcher\n'use client'\n\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/navigation'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  const router = useRouter()\n\n  return (\n    <button type=\"button\" onClick={() => router.push('/dashboard')}>\n      Dashboard\n    </button>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/example-client-component.js\" switcher\n'use client'\n\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/navigation'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  const router = useRouter()\n\n  return (\n    <button type=\"button\" onClick={() => router.push('/dashboard')}>\n      Dashboard\n    </button>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n## `useRouter()`\n\n- `router.push(href: string, { scroll: boolean })`: Perform a client-side navigation to the provided route. Adds a new entry into the [browser’s history](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/History_API) stack.\n- `router.replace(href: string, { scroll: boolean })`: Perform a client-side navigation to the provided route without adding a new entry into the [browser’s history stack](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/History_API).\n- `router.refresh()`: Refresh the current route. Making a new request to the server, re-fetching data requests, and re-rendering Server Components. The client will merge the updated React Server Component payload without losing unaffected client-side React (e.g. `useState`) or browser state (e.g. scroll position).\n- `router.prefetch(href: string)`: [Prefetch](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/linking-and-navigating#2-prefetching) the provided route for faster client-side transitions.\n- `router.back()`: Navigate back to the previous route in the browser’s history stack.\n- `router.forward()`: Navigate forwards to the next page in the browser’s history stack.\n\n> **Good to know**:\n>\n> - The `<Link>` component automatically prefetch routes as they become visible in the viewport.\n> - `refresh()` could re-produce the same result if fetch requests are cached. Other dynamic functions like `cookies` and `headers` could also change the response.\n\n### Migrating from `next/router`\n\n- The `useRouter` hook should be imported from `next/navigation` and not `next/router` when using the App Router\n- The `pathname` string has been removed and is replaced by [`usePathname()`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-pathname)\n- The `query` object has been removed and is replaced by [`useSearchParams()`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-search-params)\n- `router.events` has been replaced. [See below.](#router-events)\n\n[View the full migration guide](/docs/app/building-your-application/upgrading/app-router-migration).\n\n## Examples\n\n### Router events\n\nYou can listen for page changes by composing other Client Component hooks like `usePathname` and `useSearchParams`.\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/components/navigation-events.js\"\n'use client'\n\nimport { useEffect } from 'react'\nimport { usePathname, useSearchParams } from 'next/navigation'\n\nexport function NavigationEvents() {\n  const pathname = usePathname()\n  const searchParams = useSearchParams()\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const url = `${pathname}?${searchParams}`\n    console.log(url)\n    // You can now use the current URL\n    // ...\n  }, [pathname, searchParams])\n\n  return null\n}\n```\n\nWhich can be imported into a layout.\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/layout.js\" highlight={2,10-12}\nimport { Suspense } from 'react'\nimport { NavigationEvents } from './components/navigation-events'\n\nexport default function Layout({ children }) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <body>\n        {children}\n\n        <Suspense fallback={null}>\n          <NavigationEvents />\n        </Suspense>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know**: `<NavigationEvents>` is wrapped in a [`Suspense` boundary](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/loading-ui-and-streaming#example) because[`useSearchParams()`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-search-params) causes client-side rendering up to the closest `Suspense` boundary during [static rendering](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components#static-rendering-default). [Learn more](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-search-params#behavior).\n\n### Disabling scroll restoration\n\nBy default, Next.js will scroll to the top of the page when navigating to a new route. You can disable this behavior by passing `scroll: false` to `router.push()` or `router.replace()`.\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/example-client-component.tsx\" switcher\n'use client'\n\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/navigation'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  const router = useRouter()\n\n  return (\n    <button\n      type=\"button\"\n      onClick={() => router.push('/dashboard', { scroll: false })}\n    >\n      Dashboard\n    </button>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/example-client-component.jsx\" switcher\n'use client'\n\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/navigation'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  const router = useRouter()\n\n  return (\n    <button\n      type=\"button\"\n      onClick={() => router.push('/dashboard', { scroll: false })}\n    >\n      Dashboard\n    </button>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n## Version History\n\n| Version   | Changes                                        |\n| --------- | ---------------------------------------------- |\n| `v13.0.0` | `useRouter` from `next/navigation` introduced. |\n"},{"path":"docs/02-app/02-api-reference/04-functions/generate-metadata.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/02-app/02-api-reference/04-functions/generate-metadata.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-metadata","sha":"d1132c206a7d18c4550d9a1e53112c7c3503b83c","size":37608,"content":"---\ntitle: generateMetadata\ndescription: Learn how to add Metadata to your Next.js application for improved search engine optimization (SEO) and web shareability.\nrelated:\n  title: Next Steps\n  description: View all the Metadata API options.\n  links:\n    -

An object containing the parameters of the current route:\n\n  - `params` - An object containing the [dynamic route parameters](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes) object from the root segment down to the segment `generateMetadata` is called from. Examples:\n\n    | Route                           | URL         | `params`                  |\n    | ------------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------- |\n    | `app/shop/[slug]/page.js`       | `/shop/1`   | `{ slug: '1' }`           |\n    | `app/shop/[tag]/[item]/page.js` | `/shop/1/2` | `{ tag: '1', item: '2' }` |\n    | `app/shop/[...slug]/page.js`    | `/shop/1/2` | `{ slug: ['1', '2'] }`    |\n\n  - `searchParams` - An object containing the current URL's [search params](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_URL#parameters). Examples:\n\n    | URL             | `searchParams`       |\n    | --------------- | -------------------- |\n    | `/shop?a=1`     | `{ a: '1' }`         |\n    | `/shop?a=1&b=2` | `{ a: '1', b: '2' }` |\n    | `/shop?a=1&a=2` | `{ a: ['1', '2'] }`  |\n\n- `parent` - A promise of the resolved metadata from parent route segments.\n\n### Returns\n\n`generateMetadata` should return a [`Metadata` object](#metadata-fields) containing one or more metadata fields.\n\n> **Good to know**:\n>\n> - If metadata doesn't depend on runtime information, it should be defined using the static [`metadata` object](#the-metadata-object) rather than `generateMetadata`.\n> - `fetch` requests are automatically [memoized](/docs/app/building-your-application/caching#request-memoization) for the same data across `generateMetadata`, `generateStaticParams`, Layouts, Pages, and Server Components. React [`cache` can be used](/docs/app/building-your-application/caching#react-cache-function) if `fetch` is unavailable.\n> - `searchParams` are only available in `page.js` segments.\n> - The [`redirect()`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/redirect) and [`notFound()`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/not-found) Next.js methods can also be used inside `generateMetadata`.\n\n## Metadata Fields\n\n### `title`\n\nThe `title` attribute is used to set the title of the document. It can be defined as a simple [string](#string) or an optional [template object](#template-object).\n\n#### String\n\n```jsx filename=\"layout.js | page.js\"\nexport const metadata = {\n  title: 'Next.js',\n}\n```\n\n```html filename=\"<head> output\" hideLineNumbers\n<title>Next.js</title>\n```\n\n#### Template object\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/layout.tsx\" switcher\nimport type { Metadata } from 'next'\n\nexport const metadata: Metadata = {\n  title: {\n    template: '...',\n    default: '...',\n    absolute: '...',\n  },\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/layout.js\" switcher\nexport const metadata = {\n  title: {\n    default: '...',\n    template: '...',\n    absolute: '...',\n  },\n}\n```\n\n##### Default\n\n`title.default` can be used to provide a **fallback title** to child route segments that don't define a `title`.\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/layout.tsx\"\nimport type { Metadata } from 'next'\n\nexport const metadata: Metadata = {\n  title: {\n    default: 'Acme',\n  },\n}\n```\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/about/page.tsx\"\nimport type { Metadata } from 'next'\n\nexport const metadata: Metadata = {}\n\n// Output: <title>Acme</title>\n```\n\n##### Template\n\n`title.template` can be used to add a prefix or a suffix to `titles` defined in **child** route segments.\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/layout.tsx\" switcher\nimport type { Metadata } from 'next'\n\nexport const metadata: Metadata = {\n  title: {\n    template: '%s | Acme',\n    default: 'Acme', // a default is required when creating a template\n  },\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/layout.js\" switcher\nexport const metadata = {\n  title: {\n    template: '%s | Acme',\n    default: 'Acme', // a default is required when creating a template\n  },\n}\n```\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/about/page.tsx\" switcher\nimport type { Metadata } from 'next'\n\nexport const metadata: Metadata = {\n  title: 'About',\n}\n\n// Output: <title>About | Acme</title>\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/about/page.js\" switcher\nexport const metadata = {\n  title: 'About',\n}\n\n// Output: <title>About | Acme</title>\n```\n\n> **Good to know**:\n>\n> - `title.template` applies to **child** route segments and **not** the segment it's defined in. This means:\n>\n>   - `title.default` is **required** when you add a `title.template`.\n>   - `title.template` defined in `layout.js` will not apply to a `title` defined in a `page.js` of the same route segment.\n>   - `title.template` defined in `page.js` has no effect because a page is always the terminating segment (it doesn't have any children route segments).\n>\n> - `title.template` has **no effect** if a route has not defined a `title` or `title.default`.\n\n##### Absolute\n\n`title.absolute` can be used to provide a title that **ignores** `title.template` set in parent segments.\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/layout.tsx\" switcher\nimport type { Metadata } from 'next'\n\nexport const metadata: Metadata = {\n  title: {\n    template: '%s | Acme',\n  },\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/layout.js\" switcher\nexport const metadata = {\n  title: {\n    template: '%s | Acme',\n  },\n}\n```\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/about/page.tsx\" switcher\nimport type { Metadata } from 'next'\n\nexport const metadata: Metadata = {\n  title: {\n    absolute: 'About',\n  },\n}\n\n// Output: <title>About</title>\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/about/page.js\" switcher\nexport const metadata = {\n  title: {\n    absolute: 'About',\n  },\n}\n\n// Output: <title>About</title>\n```\n\n> **Good to know**:\n>\n> - `layout.js`\n>\n>   - `title` (string) and `title.default` define the default title for child segments (that do not define their own `title`). It will augment `title.template` from the closest parent segment if it exists.\n>   - `title.absolute` defines the default title for child segments. It ignores `title.template` from parent segments.\n>   - `title.template` defines a new title template for child segments.\n>\n> - `page.js`\n>   - If a page does not define its own title the closest parents resolved title will be used.\n>   - `title` (string) defines the routes title. It will augment `title.template` from the closest parent segment if it exists.\n>   - `title.absolute` defines the route title.

This allows Open Graph images to work on both local build and Vercel preview and production deployments. When overriding the default, we recommend using environment variables to compute the URL. This allows configuring a URL for local development, staging, and production environments.\n>\n> See more details about these environment variables in the [System Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/environment-variables/system-environment-variables) docs.\n\n#### URL Composition\n\nURL composition favors developer intent over default directory traversal semantics.\n\n- Trailing slashes between `metadataBase` and `metadata` fields are normalized.\n- An \"absolute\" path in a `metadata` field (that typically would replace the whole URL path) is treated as a \"relative\" path (starting from the end of `metadataBase`).\n\nFor example, given the following `metadataBase`:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/layout.tsx\" switcher\nimport type { Metadata } from 'next'\n\nexport const metadata: Metadata = {\n  metadataBase: new URL('https://acme.com'),\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/layout.js\" switcher\nexport const metadata = {\n  metadataBase: new URL('https://acme.com'),\n}\n```\n\nAny `metadata` fields that inherit the above `metadataBase` and set their own value will be resolved as follows:\n\n| `metadata` field                 | Resolved URL                     |\n| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |\n| `/`                              | `https://acme.com`               |\n| `./`                             | `https://acme.com`               |\n| `payments`                       | `https://acme.com/payments`      |\n| `/payments`                      | `https://acme.com/payments`      |\n| `./payments`                     | `https://acme.com/payments`      |\n| `../payments`                    | `https://acme.com/payments`      |\n| `https://beta.acme.com/payments` | `https://beta.acme.com/payments` |\n\n### `openGraph`\n\n```jsx filename=\"layout.js | page.js\"\nexport const metadata = {\n  openGraph: {\n    title: 'Next.js',\n    description: 'The React Framework for the Web',\n    url: 'https://nextjs.org',\n    siteName: 'Next.js',\n    images: [\n      {\n        url: 'https://nextjs.org/og.png', // Must be an absolute URL\n        width: 800,\n        height: 600,\n      },\n      {\n        url: 'https://nextjs.org/og-alt.png', // Must be an absolute URL\n        width: 1800,\n        height: 1600,\n        alt: 'My custom alt',\n      },\n    ],\n    videos: [\n      {\n        url: 'https://nextjs.org/video.mp4', // Must be an absolute URL\n        width: 800,\n        height: 600,\n      },\n    ],\n    locale: 'en_US',\n    type: 'website',\n  },\n}\n```\n\n```html filename=\"<head> output\" hideLineNumbers\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"Next.js\" />\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"The React Framework for the Web\" />\n<meta property=\"og:url\" content=\"https://nextjs.org/\" />\n<meta property=\"og:site_name\" content=\"Next.js\" />\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" />\n<meta property=\"og:image:url\" content=\"https://nextjs.org/og.png\" />\n<meta property=\"og:image:width\" content=\"800\" />\n<meta property=\"og:image:height\" content=\"600\" />\n<meta property=\"og:image:url\" content=\"https://nextjs.org/og-alt.png\" />\n<meta property=\"og:image:width\" content=\"1800\" />\n<meta property=\"og:image:height\" content=\"1600\" />\n<meta property=\"og:image:alt\" content=\"My custom alt\" />\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"website\" />\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"layout.js | page.js\"\nexport const metadata = {\n  openGraph: {\n    title: 'Next.js',\n    description: 'The React Framework for the Web',\n    type: 'article',\n    publishedTime: '2023-01-01T00:00:00.000Z',\n    authors: ['Seb', 'Josh'],\n  },\n}\n```\n\n```html filename=\"<head> output\" hideLineNumbers\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"Next.js\" />\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"The React Framework for the Web\" />\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" />\n<meta property=\"article:published_time\" content=\"2023-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\" />\n<meta property=\"article:author\" content=\"Seb\" />\n<meta property=\"article:author\" content=\"Josh\" />\n```\n\n> **Good to know**:\n>\n> - It may be more convenient to use the [file-based Metadata API](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/metadata/opengraph-image#image-files-jpg-png-gif) for Open Graph images.

The browser uses this information to apply preloading optimizations depending on the keyword.\n\nWhile the Metadata API doesn't directly support these hints, you can use new [`ReactDOM` methods](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/26237) to safely insert them into the `<head>` of the document.\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/preload-resources.tsx\" switcher\n'use client'\n\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom'\n\nexport function PreloadResources() {\n  ReactDOM.preload('...', { as: '...' })\n  ReactDOM.preconnect('...', { crossOrigin: '...' })\n  ReactDOM.prefetchDNS('...')\n\n  return null\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/preload-resources.js\" switcher\n'use client'\n\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom'\n\nexport function PreloadResources() {\n  ReactDOM.preload('...', { as: '...' })\n  ReactDOM.preconnect('...', { crossOrigin: '...' })\n  ReactDOM.prefetchDNS('...')\n\n  return null\n}\n```\n\n##### `<link rel=\"preload\">`\n\nStart loading a resource early in the page rendering (browser) lifecycle. [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/rel/preload).\n\n```tsx\nReactDOM.preload(href: string, options: { as: string })\n```\n\n```html filename=\"<head> output\" hideLineNumbers\n<link rel=\"preload\" href=\"...\" as=\"...\" />\n```\n\n##### `<link rel=\"preconnect\">`\n\nPreemptively initiate a connection to an origin. [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/rel/preconnect).\n\n```tsx\nReactDOM.preconnect(href: string, options?: { crossOrigin?: string })\n```\n\n```html filename=\"<head> output\" hideLineNumbers\n<link rel=\"preconnect\" href=\"...\" crossorigin />\n```\n\n##### `<link rel=\"dns-prefetch\">`\n\nAttempt to resolve a domain name before resources get requested. [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/rel/dns-prefetch).\n\n```tsx\nReactDOM.prefetchDNS(href: string)\n```\n\n```html filename=\"<head> output\" hideLineNumbers\n<link rel=\"dns-prefetch\" href=\"...\" />\n```\n\n> **Good to know**:\n>\n> - These methods are currently only supported in Client Components, which are still Server Side Rendered on initial page load.\n> - Next.js in-built features such as `next/font`, `next/image` and `next/script` automatically handle relevant resource hints.\n\n## Types\n\nYou can add type safety to your metadata by using the `Metadata` type. If you are using the [built-in TypeScript plugin](/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/typescript) in your IDE, you do not need to manually add the type, but you can still explicitly add it if you want.\n\n### `metadata` object\n\n```tsx\nimport type { Metadata } from 'next'\n\nexport const metadata: Metadata = {\n  title: 'Next.js',\n}\n```\n\n### `generateMetadata` function\n\n#### Regular function\n\n```tsx\nimport type { Metadata } from 'next'\n\nexport function generateMetadata(): Metadata {\n  return {\n    title: 'Next.js',\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Async function\n\n```tsx\nimport type { Metadata } from 'next'\n\nexport async function generateMetadata(): Promise<Metadata> {\n  return {\n    title: 'Next.js',\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### With segment props\n\n```tsx\nimport type { Metadata } from 'next'\n\ntype Props = {\n  params: { id: string }\n  searchParams: { [key: string]: string | string[] | undefined }\n}\n\nexport function generateMetadata({ params, searchParams }: Props): Metadata {\n  return {\n    title: 'Next.js',\n  }\n}\n\nexport default function Page({ params, searchParams }: Props) {}\n```\n\n#### With parent metadata\n\n```tsx\nimport type { Metadata, ResolvingMetadata } from 'next'\n\nexport async function generateMetadata(\n  { params, searchParams }: Props,\n  parent: ResolvingMetadata\n): Promise<Metadata> {\n  return {\n    title: 'Next.js',\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### JavaScript Projects\n\nFor JavaScript projects, you can use JSDoc to add type safety.\n\n```js\n/** @type {import(\"next\").Metadata} */\nexport const metadata = {\n  title: 'Next.js',\n}\n```\n\n## Version History\n\n| Version   | Changes                                                                                                                                                 |\n| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `v13.2.0` | `viewport`, `themeColor`, and `colorScheme` deprecated in favor of the [`viewport` configuration](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-viewport). |\n| `v13.2.0` | `metadata` and `generateMetadata` introduced.                                                                                                           |\n"},{"path":"docs/02-app/02-api-reference/04-functions/redirect.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/02-app/02-api-reference/04-functions/redirect.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/redirect","sha":"330a7aed1b21530af7beba830f7083c40ac1908d","size":5763,"content":"---\ntitle: redirect\ndescription: API Reference for the redirect function.\nrelated:\n  links:\n    - app/api-reference/functions/permanentRedirect\n---\n\nThe `redirect` function allows you to redirect the user to another URL. `redirect` can be used in [Server Components](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components), [Route Handlers](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-handlers), and [Server Actions](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions-and-mutations).\n\nWhen used in a [streaming context](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/loading-ui-and-streaming#what-is-streaming), this will insert a meta tag to emit the redirect on the client side. When used in a server action, it will serve a 303 HTTP redirect response to the caller. Otherwise, it will serve a 307 HTTP redirect response to the caller.\n\nIf a resource doesn't exist, you can use the [`notFound` function](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/not-found) instead.\n\n> **Good to know**:\n>\n> - In Server Actions and Route Handlers, `redirect` should be called after the `try/catch` block.\n> - If you prefer to return a 308 (Permanent) HTTP redirect instead of 307 (Temporary), you can use the [`permanentRedirect` function](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/permanentRedirect) instead.\n\n## Parameters\n\nThe `redirect` function accepts two arguments:\n\n```js\nredirect(path, type)\n```\n\n| Parameter | Type                                                          | Description                                                 |\n| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `path`    | `string`                                                      | The URL to redirect to. Can be a relative or absolute path. |\n| `type`    | `'replace'` (default) or `'push'` (default in Server Actions) | The type of redirect to perform.                            |\n\nBy default, `redirect` will use `push` (adding a new entry to the browser history stack) in [Server Actions](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions-and-mutations) and `replace` (replacing the current URL in the browser history stack) everywhere else. You can override this behavior by specifying the `type` parameter.\n\nThe `type` parameter has no effect when used in Server Components.\n\n## Returns\n\n`redirect` does not return a value.\n\n## Example\n\n### Server Component\n\nInvoking the `redirect()` function throws a `NEXT_REDIRECT` error and terminates rendering of the route segment in which it was thrown.\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/team/[id]/page.js\"\nimport { redirect } from 'next/navigation'\n\nasync function fetchTeam(id) {\n  const res = await fetch('https://...')\n  if (!res.ok) return undefined\n  return res.json()\n}\n\nexport default async function Profile({ params }) {\n  const team = await fetchTeam(params.id)\n  if (!team) {\n    redirect('/login')\n  }\n\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know**: `redirect` does not require you to use `return redirect()` as it uses the TypeScript [`never`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/functions.html#never) type.\n\n### Client Component\n\n`redirect` can be used in a Client Component through a Server Action. If you need to use an event handler to redirect the user, you can use the [`useRouter`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-router) hook.\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/client-redirect.tsx\" switcher\n'use client'\n\nimport { navigate } from './actions'\n\nexport function ClientRedirect() {\n  return (\n    <form action={navigate}>\n      <input type=\"text\" name=\"id\" />\n      <button>Submit</button>\n    </form>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/client-redirect.jsx\" switcher\n'use client'\n\nimport { navigate } from './actions'\n\nexport function ClientRedirect() {\n  return (\n    <form action={navigate}>\n      <input type=\"text\" name=\"id\" />\n      <button>Submit</button>\n    </form>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```ts filename=\"app/actions.ts\" switcher\n'use server'\n\nimport { redirect } from 'next/navigation'\n\nexport async function navigate(data: FormData) {\n  redirect(`/posts/${data.get('id')}`)\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"app/actions.js\" switcher\n'use server'\n\nimport { redirect } from 'next/navigation'\n\nexport async function navigate(data) {\n  redirect(`/posts/${data.get('id')}`)\n}\n```\n\n## FAQ\n\n### Why does `redirect` use 307 and 308?\n\nWhen using `redirect()` you may notice that the status codes used are `307` for a temporary redirect, and `308` for a permanent redirect. While traditionally a `302` was used for a temporary redirect, and a `301` for a permanent redirect, many browsers changed the request method of the redirect, from a `POST` to `GET` request when using a `302`, regardless of the origins request method.\n\nTaking the following example of a redirect from `/users` to `/people`, if you make a `POST` request to `/users` to create a new user, and are conforming to a `302` temporary redirect, the request method will be changed from a `POST` to a `GET` request. This doesn't make sense, as to create a new user, you should be making a `POST` request to `/people`, and not a `GET` request.\n\nThe introduction of the `307` status code means that the request method is preserved as `POST`.\n\n- `302` - Temporary redirect, will change the request method from `POST` to `GET`\n- `307` - Temporary redirect, will preserve the request method as `POST`\n\nThe `redirect()` method uses a `307` by default, instead of a `302` temporary redirect, meaning your requests will _always_ be preserved as `POST` requests.\n\n[Learn more](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Redirections) about HTTP Redirects.\n\n## Version History\n\n| Version   | Changes                |\n| --------- | ---------------------- |\n| `v13.0.0` | `redirect` introduced. |\n"},{"path":"docs/02-app/02-api-reference/04-functions/generate-sitemaps.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/02-app/02-api-reference/04-functions/generate-sitemaps.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-sitemaps","sha":"4d37ac178742fb9ae7bedaf7efe364fd717d26ec","size":2413,"content":"---\ntitle: generateSitemaps\nnav_title: generateSitemaps\ndescription: Learn how to use the generateSiteMaps function to create multiple sitemaps for your application.\nrelated:\n  title: Next Steps\n  description: Learn how to create sitemaps for your Next.js application.\n  links:\n    - app/api-reference/file-conventions/metadata/sitemap\n---\n\nYou can use the `generateSitemaps` function to generate multiple sitemaps for your application.\n\n## Returns\n\nThe `generateSitemaps` returns an array of objects with an `id` property.\n\n## URLs\n\nIn production, your generated sitemaps will be available at `/.../sitemap/[id].xml`.

It can contain the following properties:\n  - `tags`: An array of tags that can be used to control cache invalidation.\n  - `revalidate`: The number of seconds after which the cache should be revalidated. Omit or pass `false` to cache indefinitely or until matching `revalidateTag()` or `revalidatePath()` methods are called.\n\n## Returns\n\n`unstable_cache` returns a function that when invoked, returns a Promise that resolves to the cached data.

For example, given the `app/products/[category]/[product]` route:\n\n- `app/products/[category]/[product]/page.js` can generate params for **both** `[category]` and `[product]`.\n- `app/products/[category]/layout.js` can **only** generate params for `[category]`.\n\nThere are two approaches to generating params for a route with multiple dynamic segments:\n\n### Generate params from the bottom up\n\nGenerate multiple dynamic segments from the child route segment.\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/products/[category]/[product]/page.tsx\" switcher\n// Generate segments for both [category] and [product]\nexport async function generateStaticParams() {\n  const products = await fetch('https://.../products').then((res) => res.json())\n\n  return products.map((product) => ({\n    category: product.category.slug,\n    product: product.id,\n  }))\n}\n\nexport default function Page({\n  params,\n}: {\n  params: { category: string; product: string }\n}) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/products/[category]/[product]/page.js\" switcher\n// Generate segments for both [category] and [product]\nexport async function generateStaticParams() {\n  const products = await fetch('https://.../products').then((res) => res.json())\n\n  return products.map((product) => ({\n    category: product.category.slug,\n    product: product.id,\n  }))\n}\n\nexport default function Page({ params }) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n### Generate params from the top down\n\nGenerate the parent segments first and use the result to generate the child segments.\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/products/[category]/layout.tsx\" switcher\n// Generate segments for [category]\nexport async function generateStaticParams() {\n  const products = await fetch('https://.../products').then((res) => res.json())\n\n  return products.map((product) => ({\n    category: product.category.slug,\n  }))\n}\n\nexport default function Layout({ params }: { params: { category: string } }) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/products/[category]/layout.js\" switcher\n// Generate segments for [category]\nexport async function generateStaticParams() {\n  const products = await fetch('https://.../products').then((res) => res.json())\n\n  return products.map((product) => ({\n    category: product.category.slug,\n  }))\n}\n\nexport default function Layout({ params }) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\nA child route segment's `generateStaticParams` function is executed once for each segment a parent `generateStaticParams` generates.\n\nThe child `generateStaticParams` function can use the `params` returned from the parent `generateStaticParams` function to dynamically generate its own segments.\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/products/[category]/[product]/page.tsx\" switcher\n// Generate segments for [product] using the `params` passed from\n// the parent segment's `generateStaticParams` function\nexport async function generateStaticParams({\n  params: { category },\n}: {\n  params: { category: string }\n}) {\n  const products = await fetch(\n    `https://.../products?category=${category}`\n  ).then((res) => res.json())\n\n  return products.map((product) => ({\n    product: product.id,\n  }))\n}\n\nexport default function Page({\n  params,\n}: {\n  params: { category: string; product: string }\n}) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/products/[category]/[product]/page.js\" switcher\n// Generate segments for [product] using the `params` passed from\n// the parent segment's `generateStaticParams` function\nexport async function generateStaticParams({ params: { category } }) {\n  const products = await fetch(\n    `https://.../products?category=${category}`\n  ).then((res) => res.json())\n\n  return products.map((product) => ({\n    product: product.id,\n  }))\n}\n\nexport default function Page({ params }) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know**: `fetch` requests are automatically [memoized](/docs/app/building-your-application/caching#request-memoization) for the same data across all `generate`-prefixed functions, Layouts, Pages, and Server Components. React [`cache` can be used](/docs/app/building-your-application/caching#react-cache-function) if `fetch` is unavailable.\n\n### Generate only a subset of params\n\nYou can generate a subset of params for a route by returning an array of objects with only the dynamic segments you want to generate. Then, by using the [`dynamicParams`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/route-segment-config#dynamicparams) segment config option, you can control what happens when a dynamic segment is visited that was not generated with `generateStaticParams`.\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/blog/[slug]/page.js\"\n// All posts besides the top 10 will be a 404\nexport const dynamicParams = false\n\nexport async function generateStaticParams() {\n  const posts = await fetch('https://.../posts').then((res) => res.json())\n  const topPosts = posts.slice(0, 10)\n\n  return topPosts.map((post) => ({\n    slug: post.slug,\n  }))\n}\n```\n\n## Version History\n\n| Version   | Changes                            |\n| --------- | ---------------------------------- |\n| `v13.0.0` | `generateStaticParams` introduced. |\n"},{"path":"docs/02-app/02-api-reference/04-functions/permanentRedirect.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/02-app/02-api-reference/04-functions/permanentRedirect.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/permanentRedirect","sha":"b1f1166525490a3426d28e7d19c25c864f87dba0","size":2986,"content":"---\ntitle: permanentRedirect\ndescription: API Reference for the permanentRedirect function.\nrelated:\n  links:\n    - app/api-reference/functions/redirect\n---\n\nThe `permanentRedirect` function allows you to redirect the user to another URL. `permanentRedirect` can be used in Server Components, Client Components, [Route Handlers](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-handlers), and [Server Actions](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions-and-mutations).\n\nWhen used in a streaming context, this will insert a meta tag to emit the redirect on the client side.

This can be either an absolute external URL, or an internal path depending on the [loader](#loader) prop.\n\nWhen using an external URL, you must add it to [remotePatterns](#remotepatterns) in `next.config.js`.\n\n### `width`\n\nThe `width` property represents the _rendered_ width in pixels, so it will affect how large the image appears.\n\nRequired, except for [statically imported images](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/images#local-images) or images with the [`fill` property](#fill).\n\n### `height`\n\nThe `height` property represents the _rendered_ height in pixels, so it will affect how large the image appears.\n\nRequired, except for [statically imported images](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/images#local-images) or images with the [`fill` property](#fill).\n\n### `alt`\n\nThe `alt` property is used to describe the image for screen readers and search engines. It is also the fallback text if images have been disabled or an error occurs while loading the image.\n\nIt should contain text that could replace the image [without changing the meaning of the page](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/images.html#general-guidelines). It is not meant to supplement the image and should not repeat information that is already provided in the captions above or below the image.\n\nIf the image is [purely decorative](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/images.html#a-purely-decorative-image-that-doesn't-add-any-information) or [not intended for the user](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/images.html#an-image-not-intended-for-the-user), the `alt` property should be an empty string (`alt=\"\"`).\n\n[Learn more](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/images.html#alt)\n\n## Optional Props\n\nThe `<Image />` component accepts a number of additional properties beyond those which are required. This section describes the most commonly-used properties of the Image component. Find details about more rarely-used properties in the [Advanced Props](#advanced-props) section.\n\n### `loader`\n\nA custom function used to resolve image URLs.\n\nA `loader` is a function returning a URL string for the image, given the following parameters:\n\n- [`src`](#src)\n- [`width`](#width)\n- [`quality`](#quality)\n\nHere is an example of using a custom loader:\n\n<AppOnly>\n\n```js\n'use client'\n\nimport Image from 'next/image'\n\nconst imageLoader = ({ src, width, quality }) => {\n  return `https://example.com/${src}?w=${width}&q=${quality || 75}`\n}\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <Image\n      loader={imageLoader}\n      src=\"me.png\"\n      alt=\"Picture of the author\"\n      width={500}\n      height={500}\n    />\n  )\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know**: Using props like `loader`, which accept a function, requires using [Client Components](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/client-components) to serialize the provided function.\n\n</AppOnly>\n\n<PagesOnly>\n\n```js\nimport Image from 'next/image'\n\nconst imageLoader = ({ src, width, quality }) => {\n  return `https://example.com/${src}?w=${width}&q=${quality || 75}`\n}\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <Image\n      loader={imageLoader}\n      src=\"me.png\"\n      alt=\"Picture of the author\"\n      width={500}\n      height={500}\n    />\n  )\n}\n```\n\n</PagesOnly>\n\nAlternatively, you can use the [loaderFile](#loaderfile) configuration in `next.config.js` to configure every instance of `next/image` in your application, without passing a prop.\n\n### `fill`\n\n```js\nfill={true} // {true} | {false}\n```\n\nA boolean that causes the image to fill the parent element, which is useful when the [`width`](#width) and [`height`](#height) are unknown.\n\nThe parent element _must_ assign `position: \"relative\"`, `position: \"fixed\"`, or `position: \"absolute\"` style.\n\nBy default, the img element will automatically be assigned the `position: \"absolute\"` style.\n\nIf no styles are applied to the image, the image will stretch to fit the container. You may prefer to set `object-fit: \"contain\"` for an image which is letterboxed to fit the container and preserve aspect ratio.\n\nAlternatively, `object-fit: \"cover\"` will cause the image to fill the entire container and be cropped to preserve aspect ratio.\n\nFor more information, see also:\n\n- [`position`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/position)\n- [`object-fit`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/object-fit)\n- [`object-position`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/object-position)\n\n### `sizes`\n\nA string, similar to a media query, that provides information about how wide the image will be at different breakpoints. The value of `sizes` will greatly affect performance for images using [`fill`](#fill) or which are [styled to have a responsive size](#responsive-images).\n\nThe `sizes` property serves two important purposes related to image performance:\n\n- First, the value of `sizes` is used by the browser to determine which size of the image to download, from `next/image`'s automatically generated `srcset`. When the browser chooses, it does not yet know the size of the image on the page, so it selects an image that is the same size or larger than the viewport. The `sizes` property allows you to tell the browser that the image will actually be smaller than full screen. If you don't specify a `sizes` value in an image with the `fill` property, a default value of `100vw` (full screen width) is used.\n- Second, the `sizes` property changes the behavior of the automatically generated `srcset` value. If no `sizes` value is present, a small `srcset` is generated, suitable for a fixed-size image (1x/2x/etc). If `sizes` is defined, a large `srcset` is generated, suitable for a responsive image (640w/750w/etc). If the `sizes` property includes sizes such as `50vw`, which represent a percentage of the viewport width, then the `srcset` is trimmed to not include any values which are too small to ever be necessary.\n\nFor example, if you know your styling will cause an image to be full-width on mobile devices, in a 2-column layout on tablets, and a 3-column layout on desktop displays, you should include a sizes property such as the following:\n\n```jsx\nimport Image from 'next/image'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"grid-element\">\n      <Image\n        fill\n        src=\"/example.png\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, (max-width: 1200px) 50vw, 33vw\"\n      />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nThis example `sizes` could have a dramatic effect on performance metrics. Without the `33vw` sizes, the image selected from the server would be 3 times as wide as it needs to be. Because file size is proportional to the square of the width, without `sizes` the user would download an image that's 9 times larger than necessary.\n\nLearn more about `srcset` and `sizes`:\n\n- [web.dev](https://web.dev/learn/design/responsive-images/#sizes)\n- [mdn](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img#sizes)\n\n### `quality`\n\n```js\nquality={75} // {number 1-100}\n```\n\nThe quality of the optimized image, an integer between `1` and `100`, where `100` is the best quality and therefore largest file size. Defaults to `75`.\n\n### `priority`\n\n```js\npriority={false} // {false} | {true}\n```\n\nWhen true, the image will be considered high priority and\n[preload](https://web.dev/preload-responsive-images/). Lazy loading is automatically disabled for images using `priority`.\n\nYou should use the `priority` property on any image detected as the [Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)](https://nextjs.org/learn/seo/web-performance/lcp) element. It may be appropriate to have multiple priority images, as different images may be the LCP element for different viewport sizes.\n\nShould only be used when the image is visible above the fold. Defaults to `false`.\n\n### `placeholder`\n\n```js\nplaceholder = 'empty' // \"empty\" | \"blur\" | \"data:image/...\"\n```\n\nA placeholder to use while the image is loading. Possible values are `blur`, `empty`, or `data:image/...`. Defaults to `empty`.\n\nWhen `blur`, the [`blurDataURL`](#blurdataurl) property will be used as the placeholder. If `src` is an object from a [static import](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/images#local-images) and the imported image is `.jpg`, `.png`, `.webp`, or `.avif`, then `blurDataURL` will be automatically populated, except when the image is detected to be animated.\n\nFor dynamic images, you must provide the [`blurDataURL`](#blurdataurl) property. Solutions such as [Plaiceholder](https://github.com/joe-bell/plaiceholder) can help with `base64` generation.\n\nWhen `data:image/...`, the [Data URL](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Data_URIs) will be used as the placeholder while the image is loading.\n\nWhen `empty`, there will be no placeholder while the image is loading, only empty space.\n\nTry it out:\n\n- [Demo the `blur` placeholder](https://image-component.nextjs.gallery/placeholder)\n- [Demo the shimmer effect with data URL `placeholder` prop](https://image-component.nextjs.gallery/shimmer)\n- [Demo the color effect with `blurDataURL` prop](https://image-component.nextjs.gallery/color)\n\n## Advanced Props\n\nIn some cases, you may need more advanced usage. The `<Image />` component optionally accepts the following advanced properties.\n\n### `style`\n\nAllows passing CSS styles to the underlying image element.\n\n```jsx filename=\"components/ProfileImage.js\"\nconst imageStyle = {\n  borderRadius: '50%',\n  border: '1px solid #fff',\n}\n\nexport default function ProfileImage() {\n  return <Image src=\"...\" style={imageStyle} />\n}\n```\n\nRemember that the required width and height props can interact with your styling. If you use styling to modify an image's width, you should also style its height to `auto` to preserve its intrinsic aspect ratio, or your image will be distorted.\n\n### `onLoadingComplete`\n\n<AppOnly>\n\n```jsx\n'use client'\n\n<Image onLoadingComplete={(img) => console.log(img.naturalWidth)} />\n```\n\n</AppOnly>\n\n<PagesOnly>\n\n```jsx\n<Image onLoadingComplete={(img) => console.log(img.naturalWidth)} />\n```\n\n</PagesOnly>\n\n> **Warning**: Deprecated since Next.js 14 in favor of [`onLoad`](#onload).\n\nA callback function that is invoked once the image is completely loaded and the [placeholder](#placeholder) has been removed.\n\nThe callback function will be called with one argument, a reference to the underlying `<img>` element.\n\n<AppOnly>\n\n> **Good to know**: Using props like `onLoadingComplete`, which accept a function, requires using [Client Components](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/client-components) to serialize the provided function.\n\n</AppOnly>\n\n### `onLoad`\n\n```jsx\n<Image onLoad={(e) => console.log(e.target.naturalWidth)} />\n```\n\nA callback function that is invoked once the image is completely loaded and the [placeholder](#placeholder) has been removed.\n\nThe callback function will be called with one argument, the Event which has a `target` that references the underlying `<img>` element.\n\n<AppOnly>\n\n> **Good to know**: Using props like `onLoad`, which accept a function, requires using [Client Components](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/client-components) to serialize the provided function.\n\n</AppOnly>\n\n### `onError`\n\n```jsx\n<Image onError={(e) => console.error(e.target.id)} />\n```\n\nA callback function that is invoked if the image fails to load.\n\n<AppOnly>\n\n> **Good to know**: Using props like `onError`, which accept a function, requires using [Client Components](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/client-components) to serialize the provided function.\n\n</AppOnly>\n\n### `loading`\n\n> **Recommendation**: This property is only meant for advanced use cases. Switching an image to load with `eager` will normally **hurt performance**. We recommend using the [`priority`](#priority) property instead, which will eagerly preload the image.\n\n```js\nloading = 'lazy' // {lazy} | {eager}\n```\n\nThe loading behavior of the image. Defaults to `lazy`.\n\nWhen `lazy`, defer loading the image until it reaches a calculated distance from\nthe viewport.\n\nWhen `eager`, load the image immediately.\n\nLearn more about the [`loading` attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img#loading).\n\n### `blurDataURL`\n\nA [Data URL](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Data_URIs) to\nbe used as a placeholder image before the `src` image successfully loads. Only takes effect when combined\nwith [`placeholder=\"blur\"`](#placeholder).\n\nMust be a base64-encoded image. It will be enlarged and blurred, so a very small image (10px or\nless) is recommended. Including larger images as placeholders may harm your application performance.\n\nTry it out:\n\n- [Demo the default `blurDataURL` prop](https://image-component.nextjs.gallery/placeholder)\n- [Demo the color effect with `blurDataURL` prop](https://image-component.nextjs.gallery/color)\n\nYou can also [generate a solid color Data URL](https://png-pixel.com) to match the image.\n\n### `unoptimized`\n\n```js\nunoptimized = {false} // {false} | {true}\n```\n\nWhen true, the source image will be served as-is instead of changing quality,\nsize, or format. Defaults to `false`.\n\n```js\nimport Image from 'next/image'\n\nconst UnoptimizedImage = (props) => {\n  return <Image {...props} unoptimized />\n}\n```\n\nSince Next.js 12.3.0, this prop can be assigned to all images by updating `next.config.js` with the following configuration:\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    unoptimized: true,\n  },\n}\n```\n\n### `overrideSrc`\n\nWhen providing the `src` prop to the `<Image>` component, both the `srcset` and `src` attributes are generated automatically for the resulting `<img>`.\n\n```jsx filename=\"input.js\"\n<Image src=\"/me.jpg\" />\n```\n\n```html filename=\"output.html\"\n<img\n  srcset=\"\n    /_next/image?url=%2Fme.jpg&w=640&q=75 1x,\n    /_next/image?url=%2Fme.jpg&w=828&q=75 2x\n  \"\n  src=\"/_next/image?url=%2Fme.jpg&w=828&q=75\"\n/>\n```\n\nIn some cases, it is not desirable to have the `src` attribute generated and you may wish to override it using the `overrideSrc` prop.\n\nFor example, when upgrading an existing website from `<img>` to `<Image>`, you may wish to maintain the same `src` attribute for SEO purposes such as image ranking or avoiding recrawl.\n\n```jsx filename=\"input.js\"\n<Image src=\"/me.jpg\" overrideSrc=\"/override.jpg\" />\n```\n\n```html filename=\"output.html\"\n<img\n  srcset=\"\n    /_next/image?url=%2Fme.jpg&w=640&q=75 1x,\n    /_next/image?url=%2Fme.jpg&w=828&q=75 2x\n  \"\n  src=\"/override.jpg\"\n/>\n```\n\n### Other Props\n\nOther properties on the `<Image />` component will be passed to the underlying\n`img` element with the exception of the following:\n\n- `srcSet`. Use [Device Sizes](#devicesizes) instead.\n- `decoding`. It is always `\"async\"`.\n\n## Configuration Options\n\nIn addition to props, you can configure the Image Component in `next.config.js`. The following options are available:\n\n### `remotePatterns`\n\nTo protect your application from malicious users, configuration is required in order to use external images. This ensures that only external images from your account can be served from the Next.js Image Optimization API. These external images can be configured with the `remotePatterns` property in your `next.config.js` file, as shown below:\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    remotePatterns: [\n      {\n        protocol: 'https',\n        hostname: 'example.com',\n        port: '',\n        pathname: '/account123/**',\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know**: The example above will ensure the `src` property of `next/image` must start with `https://example.com/account123/`. Any other protocol, hostname, port, or unmatched path will respond with 400 Bad Request.\n\nBelow is another example of the `remotePatterns` property in the `next.config.js` file:\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    remotePatterns: [\n      {\n        protocol: 'https',\n        hostname: '**.example.com',\n        port: '',\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know**: The example above will ensure the `src` property of `next/image` must start with `https://img1.example.com` or `https://me.avatar.example.com` or any number of subdomains. Any other protocol, port, or unmatched hostname will respond with 400 Bad Request.\n\nWildcard patterns can be used for both `pathname` and `hostname` and have the following syntax:\n\n- `*` match a single path segment or subdomain\n- `**` match any number of path segments at the end or subdomains at the beginning\n\nThe `**` syntax does not work in the middle of the pattern.\n\n> **Good to know**: When omitting `protocol`, `port` or `pathname`, then the wildcard `**` is implied. This is not recommended because it may allow malicious actors to optimize urls you did not intend.\n\n### `domains`\n\n> **Warning**: Deprecated since Next.js 14 in favor of strict [`remotePatterns`](#remotepatterns) in order to protect your application from malicious users. Only use `domains` if you own all the content served from the domain.\n\nSimilar to [`remotePatterns`](#remotepatterns), the `domains` configuration can be used to provide a list of allowed hostnames for external images.\n\nHowever, the `domains` configuration does not support wildcard pattern matching and it cannot restrict protocol, port, or pathname.\n\nBelow is an example of the `domains` property in the `next.config.js` file:\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    domains: ['assets.acme.com'],\n  },\n}\n```\n\n### `loaderFile`\n\nIf you want to use a cloud provider to optimize images instead of using the Next.js built-in Image Optimization API, you can configure the `loaderFile` in your `next.config.js` like the following:\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    loader: 'custom',\n    loaderFile: './my/image/loader.js',\n  },\n}\n```\n\nThis must point to a file relative to the root of your Next.js application. The file must export a default function that returns a string, for example:\n\n<AppOnly>\n\n```js filename=\"my/image/loader.js\"\n'use client'\n\nexport default function myImageLoader({ src, width, quality }) {\n  return `https://example.com/${src}?w=${width}&q=${quality || 75}`\n}\n```\n\n</AppOnly>\n\n<PagesOnly>\n\n```js filename=\"my/image/loader.js\"\nexport default function myImageLoader({ src, width, quality }) {\n  return `https://example.com/${src}?w=${width}&q=${quality || 75}`\n}\n```\n\n</PagesOnly>\n\nAlternatively, you can use the [`loader` prop](#loader) to configure each instance of `next/image`.\n\nExamples:\n\n- [Custom Image Loader Configuration](/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/images#example-loader-configuration)\n\n<AppOnly>\n\n> **Good to know**: Customizing the image loader file, which accepts a function, requires using [Client Components](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/client-components) to serialize the provided function.\n\n</AppOnly>\n\n## Advanced\n\nThe following configuration is for advanced use cases and is usually not necessary. If you choose to configure the properties below, you will override any changes to the Next.js defaults in future updates.\n\n### `deviceSizes`\n\nIf you know the expected device widths of your users, you can specify a list of device width breakpoints using the `deviceSizes` property in `next.config.js`. These widths are used when the `next/image` component uses [`sizes`](#sizes) prop to ensure the correct image is served for user's device.\n\nIf no configuration is provided, the default below is used.\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    deviceSizes: [640, 750, 828, 1080, 1200, 1920, 2048, 3840],\n  },\n}\n```\n\n### `imageSizes`\n\nYou can specify a list of image widths using the `images.imageSizes` property in your `next.config.js` file. These widths are concatenated with the array of [device sizes](#devicesizes) to form the full array of sizes used to generate image [srcset](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/HTMLImageElement/srcset)s.\n\nThe reason there are two separate lists is that imageSizes is only used for images which provide a [`sizes`](#sizes) prop, which indicates that the image is less than the full width of the screen. **Therefore, the sizes in imageSizes should all be smaller than the smallest size in deviceSizes.**\n\nIf no configuration is provided, the default below is used.\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    imageSizes: [16, 32, 48, 64, 96, 128, 256, 384],\n  },\n}\n```\n\n### `formats`\n\nThe default [Image Optimization API](#loader) will automatically detect the browser's supported image formats via the request's `Accept` header.\n\nIf the `Accept` head matches more than one of the configured formats, the first match in the array is used. Therefore, the array order matters. If there is no match (or the source image is [animated](#animated-images)), the Image Optimization API will fallback to the original image's format.\n\nIf no configuration is provided, the default below is used.\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    formats: ['image/webp'],\n  },\n}\n```\n\nYou can enable AVIF support with the following configuration.\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    formats: ['image/avif', 'image/webp'],\n  },\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know**:\n>\n> - AVIF generally takes 20% longer to encode but it compresses 20% smaller compared to WebP. This means that the first time an image is requested, it will typically be slower and then subsequent requests that are cached will be faster.\n> - If you self-host with a Proxy/CDN in front of Next.js, you must configure the Proxy to forward the `Accept` header.\n\n## Caching Behavior\n\nThe following describes the caching algorithm for the default [loader](#loader). For all other loaders, please refer to your cloud provider's documentation.\n\nImages are optimized dynamically upon request and stored in the `<distDir>/cache/images` directory. The optimized image file will be served for subsequent requests until the expiration is reached. When a request is made that matches a cached but expired file, the expired image is served stale immediately. Then the image is optimized again in the background (also called revalidation) and saved to the cache with the new expiration date.\n\nThe cache status of an image can be determined by reading the value of the `x-nextjs-cache` response header. The possible values are the following:\n\n- `MISS` - the path is not in the cache (occurs at most once, on the first visit)\n- `STALE` - the path is in the cache but exceeded the revalidate time so it will be updated in the background\n- `HIT` - the path is in the cache and has not exceeded the revalidate time\n\nThe expiration (or rather Max Age) is defined by either the [`minimumCacheTTL`](#minimumcachettl) configuration or the upstream image `Cache-Control` header, whichever is larger. Specifically, the `max-age` value of the `Cache-Control` header is used. If both `s-maxage` and `max-age` are found, then `s-maxage` is preferred. The `max-age` is also passed-through to any downstream clients including CDNs and browsers.\n\n- You can configure [`minimumCacheTTL`](#minimumcachettl) to increase the cache duration when the upstream image does not include `Cache-Control` header or the value is very low.\n- You can configure [`deviceSizes`](#devicesizes) and [`imageSizes`](#imagesizes) to reduce the total number of possible generated images.\n- You can configure [formats](#formats) to disable multiple formats in favor of a single image format.\n\n### `minimumCacheTTL`\n\nYou can configure the Time to Live (TTL) in seconds for cached optimized images. In many cases, it's better to use a [Static Image Import](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/images#local-images) which will automatically hash the file contents and cache the image forever with a `Cache-Control` header of `immutable`.\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    minimumCacheTTL: 60,\n  },\n}\n```\n\nThe expiration (or rather Max Age) of the optimized image is defined by either the `minimumCacheTTL` or the upstream image `Cache-Control` header, whichever is larger.\n\nIf you need to change the caching behavior per image, you can configure [`headers`](/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/headers) to set the `Cache-Control` header on the upstream image (e.g. `/some-asset.jpg`, not `/_next/image` itself).\n\nThere is no mechanism to invalidate the cache at this time, so its best to keep `minimumCacheTTL` low. Otherwise you may need to manually change the [`src`](#src) prop or delete `<distDir>/cache/images`.\n\n### `disableStaticImages`\n\nThe default behavior allows you to import static files such as `import icon from './icon.png'` and then pass that to the `src` property.\n\nIn some cases, you may wish to disable this feature if it conflicts with other plugins that expect the import to behave differently.\n\nYou can disable static image imports inside your `next.config.js`:\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    disableStaticImages: true,\n  },\n}\n```\n\n### `dangerouslyAllowSVG`\n\nThe default [loader](#loader) does not optimize SVG images for a few reasons. First, SVG is a vector format meaning it can be resized losslessly. Second, SVG has many of the same features as HTML/CSS, which can lead to vulnerabilities without proper [Content Security Policy (CSP) headers](/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/headers#content-security-policy).\n\nTherefore, we recommended using the [`unoptimized`](#unoptimized) prop when the [`src`](#src) prop is known to be SVG. This happens automatically when `src` ends with `\".svg\"`.\n\nHowever, if you need to serve SVG images with the default Image Optimization API, you can set `dangerouslyAllowSVG` inside your `next.config.js`:\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    dangerouslyAllowSVG: true,\n    contentDispositionType: 'attachment',\n    contentSecurityPolicy: \"default-src 'self'; script-src 'none'; sandbox;\",\n  },\n}\n```\n\nIn addition, it is strongly recommended to also set `contentDispositionType` to force the browser to download the image, as well as `contentSecurityPolicy` to prevent scripts embedded in the image from executing.\n\n### `contentDispositionType`\n\nThe default [loader](#loader) sets the [`Content-Disposition`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Disposition#as_a_response_header_for_the_main_body) header to `attachment` for added protection since the API can serve arbitrary remote images.\n\nThe default value is `attachment` which forces the browser to download the image when visiting directly. This is particularly important when [`dangerouslyAllowSVG`](#dangerouslyallowsvg) is true.\n\nYou can optionally configure `inline` to allow the browser to render the image when visiting directly, without downloading it.\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    contentDispositionType: 'inline',\n  },\n}\n```\n\n## Animated Images\n\nThe default [loader](#loader) will automatically bypass Image Optimization for animated images and serve the image as-is.\n\nAuto-detection for animated files is best-effort and supports GIF, APNG, and WebP. If you want to explicitly bypass Image Optimization for a given animated image, use the [unoptimized](#unoptimized) prop.\n\n## Responsive Images\n\nThe default generated `srcset` contains `1x` and `2x` images in order to support different device pixel ratios. However, you may wish to render a responsive image that stretches with the viewport. In that case, you'll need to set [`sizes`](#sizes) as well as `style` (or `className`).\n\nYou can render a responsive image using one of the following methods below.\n\n### Responsive image using a static import\n\nIf the source image is not dynamic, you can statically import to create a responsive image:\n\n```jsx filename=\"components/author.js\"\nimport Image from 'next/image'\nimport me from '../photos/me.jpg'\n\nexport default function Author() {\n  return (\n    <Image\n      src={me}\n      alt=\"Picture of the author\"\n      sizes=\"100vw\"\n      style={{\n        width: '100%',\n        height: 'auto',\n      }}\n    />\n  )\n}\n```\n\nTry it out:\n\n- [Demo the image responsive to viewport](https://image-component.nextjs.gallery/responsive)\n\n### Responsive image with aspect ratio\n\nIf the source image is a dynamic or a remote url, you will also need to provide `width` and `height` to set the correct aspect ratio of the responsive image:\n\n```jsx filename=\"components/page.js\"\nimport Image from 'next/image'\n\nexport default function Page({ photoUrl }) {\n  return (\n    <Image\n      src={photoUrl}\n      alt=\"Picture of the author\"\n      sizes=\"100vw\"\n      style={{\n        width: '100%',\n        height: 'auto',\n      }}\n      width={500}\n      height={300}\n    />\n  )\n}\n```\n\nTry it out:\n\n- [Demo the image responsive to viewport](https://image-component.nextjs.gallery/responsive)\n\n### Responsive image with `fill`\n\nIf you don't know the aspect ratio, you will need to set the [`fill`](#fill) prop and set `position: relative` on the parent. Optionally, you can set `object-fit` style depending on the desired stretch vs crop behavior:\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/page.js\"\nimport Image from 'next/image'\n\nexport default function Page({ photoUrl }) {\n  return (\n    <div style={{ position: 'relative', width: '300px', height: '500px' }}>\n      <Image\n        src={photoUrl}\n        alt=\"Picture of the author\"\n        sizes=\"300px\"\n        fill\n        style={{\n          objectFit: 'contain',\n        }}\n      />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nTry it out:\n\n- [Demo the `fill` prop](https://image-component.nextjs.gallery/fill)\n\n## Theme Detection CSS\n\nIf you want to display a different image for light and dark mode, you can create a new component that wraps two `<Image>` components and reveals the correct one based on a CSS media query.\n\n```css filename=\"components/theme-image.module.css\"\n.imgDark {\n  display: none;\n}\n\n@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {\n  .imgLight {\n    display: none;\n  }\n  .imgDark {\n    display: unset;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```tsx filename=\"components/theme-image.tsx\" switcher\nimport styles from './theme-image.module.css'\nimport Image, { ImageProps } from 'next/image'\n\ntype Props = Omit<ImageProps, 'src' | 'priority' | 'loading'> & {\n  srcLight: string\n  srcDark: string\n}\n\nconst ThemeImage = (props: Props) => {\n  const { srcLight, srcDark, ...rest } = props\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Image {...rest} src={srcLight} className={styles.imgLight} />\n      <Image {...rest} src={srcDark} className={styles.imgDark} />\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"components/theme-image.js\" switcher\nimport styles from './theme-image.module.css'\nimport Image from 'next/image'\n\nconst ThemeImage = (props) => {\n  const { srcLight, srcDark, ...rest } = props\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Image {...rest} src={srcLight} className={styles.imgLight} />\n      <Image {...rest} src={srcDark} className={styles.imgDark} />\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know**: The default behavior of `loading=\"lazy\"` ensures that only the correct image is loaded. You cannot use `priority` or `loading=\"eager\"` because that would cause both images to load. Instead, you can use [`fetchPriority=\"high\"`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/HTMLImageElement/fetchPriority).\n\nTry it out:\n\n- [Demo light/dark mode theme detection](https://image-component.nextjs.gallery/theme)\n\n## getImageProps\n\nFor more advanced use cases, you can call `getImageProps()` to get the props that would be passed to the underlying `<img>` element, and instead pass to them to another component, style, canvas, etc.\n\nThis also avoid calling React `useState()` so it can lead to better performance, but it cannot be used with the [`placeholder`](#placeholder) prop because the placeholder will never be removed.\n\n### Theme Detection Picture\n\nIf you want to display a different image for light and dark mode, you can use the [`<picture>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/picture) element to display a different image based on the user's [preferred color scheme](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme).\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/page.js\"\nimport { getImageProps } from 'next/image'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  const common = { alt: 'Theme Example', width: 800, height: 400 }\n  const {\n    props: { srcSet: dark },\n  } = getImageProps({ ...common, src: '/dark.png' })\n  const {\n    props: { srcSet: light, ...rest },\n  } = getImageProps({ ...common, src: '/light.png' })\n\n  return (\n    <picture>\n      <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcSet={dark} />\n      <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcSet={light} />\n      <img {...rest} />\n    </picture>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### Art Direction\n\nIf you want to display a different image for mobile and desktop, sometimes called [Art Direction](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images#art_direction), you can provide different `src`, `width`, `height`, and `quality` props to `getImageProps()`.\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/page.js\"\nimport { getImageProps } from 'next/image'\n\nexport default function Home() {\n  const common = { alt: 'Art Direction Example', sizes: '100vw' }\n  const {\n    props: { srcSet: desktop },\n  } = getImageProps({\n    ...common,\n    width: 1440,\n    height: 875,\n    quality: 80,\n    src: '/desktop.jpg',\n  })\n  const {\n    props: { srcSet: mobile, ...rest },\n  } = getImageProps({\n    ...common,\n    width: 750,\n    height: 1334,\n    quality: 70,\n    src: '/mobile.jpg',\n  })\n\n  return (\n    <picture>\n      <source media=\"(min-width: 1000px)\" srcSet={desktop} />\n      <source media=\"(min-width: 500px)\" srcSet={mobile} />\n      <img {...rest} style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }} />\n    </picture>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### Background CSS\n\nYou can even convert the `srcSet` string to the [`image-set()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/image/image-set) CSS function to optimize a background image.\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/page.js\"\nimport { getImageProps } from 'next/image'\n\nfunction getBackgroundImage(srcSet = '') {\n  const imageSet = srcSet\n    .split(', ')\n    .map((str) => {\n      const [url, dpi] = str.split(' ')\n      return `url(\"${url}\") ${dpi}`\n    })\n    .join(', ')\n  return `image-set(${imageSet})`\n}\n\nexport default function Home() {\n  const {\n    props: { srcSet },\n  } = getImageProps({ alt: '', width: 128, height: 128, src: '/img.png' })\n  const backgroundImage = getBackgroundImage(srcSet)\n  const style = { height: '100vh', width: '100vw', backgroundImage }\n\n  return (\n    <main style={style}>\n      <h1>Hello World</h1>\n    </main>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n## Known Browser Bugs\n\nThis `next/image` component uses browser native [lazy loading](https://caniuse.com/loading-lazy-attr), which may fallback to eager loading for older browsers before Safari 15.4. When using the blur-up placeholder, older browsers before Safari 12 will fallback to empty placeholder. When using styles with `width`/`height` of `auto`, it is possible to cause [Layout Shift](https://web.dev/cls/) on older browsers before Safari 15 that don't [preserve the aspect ratio](https://caniuse.com/mdn-html_elements_img_aspect_ratio_computed_from_attributes). For more details, see [this MDN video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-d_SoCHeWE).\n\n- [Safari 15 - 16.3](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=243601) display a gray border while loading.

Next.js prefetches and loads the linked route (denoted by the `href`) and its data in the background to improve the performance of client-side navigations. Prefetching is only enabled in production.\n\n- **`null` (default)**: Prefetch behavior depends on whether the route is static or dynamic. For static routes, the full route will be prefetched (including all its data). For dynamic routes, the partial route down to the nearest segment with a [`loading.js`](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/loading-ui-and-streaming#instant-loading-states) boundary will be prefetched.\n- `true`: The full route will be prefetched for both static and dynamic routes.\n- `false`: Prefetching will never happen both on entering the viewport and on hover.\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/page.tsx\" switcher\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <Link href=\"/dashboard\" prefetch={false}>\n      Dashboard\n    </Link>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/page.js\" switcher\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <Link href=\"/dashboard\" prefetch={false}>\n      Dashboard\n    </Link>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n</AppOnly>\n\n<PagesOnly>\n\nPrefetching happens when a `<Link />` component enters the user's viewport (initially or through scroll). Next.js prefetches and loads the linked route (denoted by the `href`) and data in the background to improve the performance of client-side navigations. Prefetching is only enabled in production.\n\n- **`true` (default)**: The full route and its data will be prefetched.\n- `false`: Prefetching will not happen when entering the viewport, but will happen on hover. If you want to completely remove fetching on hover as well, consider using an `<a>` tag or [incrementally adopting](/docs/app/building-your-application/upgrading/app-router-migration) the App Router, which enables disabling prefetching on hover too.\n\n```tsx filename=\"pages/index.tsx\" switcher\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <Link href=\"/dashboard\" prefetch={false}>\n      Dashboard\n    </Link>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"pages/index.js\" switcher\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <Link href=\"/dashboard\" prefetch={false}>\n      Dashboard\n    </Link>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n## Other Props\n\n### `legacyBehavior`\n\nAn `<a>` element is no longer required as a child of `<Link>`. Add the `legacyBehavior` prop to use the legacy behavior or remove the `<a>` to upgrade. A [codemod is available](/docs/app/building-your-application/upgrading/codemods#new-link) to automatically upgrade your code.\n\n> **Good to know**: when `legacyBehavior` is not set to `true`, all [`anchor`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a) tag properties can be passed to `next/link` as well such as, `className`, `onClick`, etc.\n\n### `passHref`\n\nForces `Link` to send the `href` property to its child. Defaults to `false`\n\n### `scroll`\n\nScroll to the top of the page after a navigation. Defaults to `true`\n\n### `shallow`\n\nUpdate the path of the current page without rerunning [`getStaticProps`](/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-static-props), [`getServerSideProps`](/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-server-side-props) or [`getInitialProps`](/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/get-initial-props). Defaults to `false`\n\n### `locale`\n\nThe active locale is automatically prepended. `locale` allows for providing a different locale. When `false` `href` has to include the locale as the default behavior is disabled.\n\n</PagesOnly>\n\n## Examples\n\n### Linking to Dynamic Routes\n\nFor dynamic routes, it can be handy to use template literals to create the link's path.\n\n<PagesOnly>\n\nFor example, you can generate a list of links to the dynamic route `pages/blog/[slug].js`\n\n```jsx filename=\"pages/blog/index.js\"\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n\nfunction Posts({ posts }) {\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {posts.map((post) => (\n        <li key={post.id}>\n          <Link href={`/blog/${post.slug}`}>{post.title}</Link>\n        </li>\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default Posts\n```\n\n</PagesOnly>\n\n<AppOnly>\n\nFor example, you can generate a list of links to the dynamic route `app/blog/[slug]/page.js`:\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/blog/page.js\"\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n\nfunction Page({ posts }) {\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {posts.map((post) => (\n        <li key={post.id}>\n          <Link href={`/blog/${post.slug}`}>{post.title}</Link>\n        </li>\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n</AppOnly>\n\n### If the child is a custom component that wraps an `<a>` tag\n\n<AppOnly>\n\nIf the child of `Link` is a custom component that wraps an `<a>` tag, you must add `passHref` to `Link`. This is necessary if you’re using libraries like [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/). Without this, the `<a>` tag will not have the `href` attribute, which hurts your site's accessibility and might affect SEO. If you're using [ESLint](/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/eslint#eslint-plugin), there is a built-in rule `next/link-passhref` to ensure correct usage of `passHref`.\n\n</AppOnly>\n\n<PagesOnly>\n\nIf the child of `Link` is a custom component that wraps an `<a>` tag, you must add `passHref` to `Link`.

If you're using [ESLint](/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/eslint#eslint-plugin), there is a built-in rule `next/link-passhref` to ensure correct usage of `passHref`.\n\n</PagesOnly>\n\n```jsx\nimport Link from 'next/link'\nimport styled from 'styled-components'\n\n// This creates a custom component that wraps an <a> tag\nconst RedLink = styled.a`\n  color: red;\n`\n\nfunction NavLink({ href, name }) {\n  return (\n    <Link href={href} passHref legacyBehavior>\n      <RedLink>{name}</RedLink>\n    </Link>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default NavLink\n```\n\n- If you’re using [emotion](https://emotion.sh/)’s JSX pragma feature (`@jsx jsx`), you must use `passHref` even if you use an `<a>` tag directly.\n- The component should support `onClick` property to trigger navigation correctly\n\n### If the child is a functional component\n\nIf the child of `Link` is a functional component, in addition to using `passHref` and `legacyBehavior`, you must wrap the component in [`React.forwardRef`](https://react.dev/reference/react/forwardRef):\n\n```jsx\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n\n// `onClick`, `href`, and `ref` need to be passed to the DOM element\n// for proper handling\nconst MyButton = React.forwardRef(({ onClick, href }, ref) => {\n  return (\n    <a href={href} onClick={onClick} ref={ref}>\n      Click Me\n    </a>\n  )\n})\n\nfunction Home() {\n  return (\n    <Link href=\"/about\" passHref legacyBehavior>\n      <MyButton />\n    </Link>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default Home\n```\n\n<PagesOnly>\n\n### With URL Object\n\n`Link` can also receive a URL object and it will automatically format it to create the URL string. Here's how to do it:\n\n```jsx\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n\nfunction Home() {\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        <Link\n          href={{\n            pathname: '/about',\n            query: { name: 'test' },\n          }}\n        >\n          About us\n        </Link>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <Link\n          href={{\n            pathname: '/blog/[slug]',\n            query: { slug: 'my-post' },\n          }}\n        >\n          Blog Post\n        </Link>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default Home\n```\n\nThe above example has a link to:\n\n- A predefined route: `/about?name=test`\n- A [dynamic route](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes): `/blog/my-post`\n\nYou can use every property as defined in the [Node.js URL module documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/url.html#url_url_strings_and_url_objects).\n\n</PagesOnly>\n\n### Replace the URL instead of push\n\nThe default behavior of the `Link` component is to `push` a new URL into the `history` stack. You can use the `replace` prop to prevent adding a new entry, as in the following example:\n\n```jsx\n<Link href=\"/about\" replace>\n  About us\n</Link>\n```\n\n### Disable scrolling to the top of the page\n\nThe default behavior of `Link` is to scroll to the top of the page. When there is a hash defined it will scroll to the specific id, like a normal `<a>` tag. To prevent scrolling to the top / hash `scroll={false}` can be added to `Link`:\n\n```jsx\n<Link href=\"/#hashid\" scroll={false}>\n  Disables scrolling to the top\n</Link>\n```\n\n### Middleware\n\nIt's common to use [Middleware](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware) for authentication or other purposes that involve rewriting the user to a different page. In order for the `<Link />` component to properly prefetch links with rewrites via Middleware, you need to tell Next.js both the URL to display and the URL to prefetch. This is required to avoid un-necessary fetches to middleware to know the correct route to prefetch.\n\nFor example, if you want to serve a `/dashboard` route that has authenticated and visitor views, you may add something similar to the following in your Middleware to redirect the user to the correct page:\n\n```js filename=\"middleware.js\"\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  const nextUrl = req.nextUrl\n  if (nextUrl.pathname === '/dashboard') {\n    if (req.cookies.authToken) {\n      return NextResponse.rewrite(new URL('/auth/dashboard', req.url))\n    } else {\n      return NextResponse.rewrite(new URL('/public/dashboard', req.url))\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this case, you would want to use the following code in your `<Link />` component:\n\n```js\nimport Link from 'next/link'\nimport useIsAuthed from './hooks/useIsAuthed'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  const isAuthed = useIsAuthed()\n  const path = isAuthed ? '/auth/dashboard' : '/public/dashboard'\n  return (\n    <Link as=\"/dashboard\" href={path}>\n      Dashboard\n    </Link>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n<PagesOnly>\n\n> **Good to know**: If you're using [Dynamic Routes](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes), you'll need to adapt your `as` and `href` props. For example, if you have a Dynamic Route like `/dashboard/authed/[user]` that you want to present differently via middleware, you would write: `<Link href={{ pathname: '/dashboard/authed/[user]', query: { user: username } }} as=\"/dashboard/[user]\">Profile</Link>`.\n\n</PagesOnly>\n\n## Version History\n\n| Version   | Changes                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `v13.0.0` | No longer requires a child `<a>` tag.

This can be either an absolute external URL or an internal path. The `src` property is required unless an inline script is used.\n\n## Optional Props\n\nThe `<Script />` component accepts a number of additional properties beyond those which are required.\n\n### `strategy`\n\nThe loading strategy of the script. There are four different strategies that can be used:\n\n- `beforeInteractive`: Load before any Next.js code and before any page hydration occurs.\n- `afterInteractive`: (**default**) Load early but after some hydration on the page occurs.\n- `lazyOnload`: Load during browser idle time.\n- `worker`: (experimental) Load in a web worker.\n\n### `beforeInteractive`\n\nScripts that load with the `beforeInteractive` strategy are injected into the initial HTML from the server, downloaded before any Next.js module, and executed in the order they are placed before _any_ hydration occurs on the page.\n\nScripts denoted with this strategy are preloaded and fetched before any first-party code, but their execution does not block page hydration from occurring.\n\n<AppOnly>\n\n`beforeInteractive` scripts must be placed inside the root layout (`app/layout.tsx`) and are designed to load scripts that are needed by the entire site (i.e. the script will load when any page in the application has been loaded server-side).\n\n</AppOnly>\n\n<PagesOnly>\n\n`beforeInteractive` scripts must be placed inside the `Document` Component (`pages/_document.js`) and are designed to load scripts that are needed by the entire site (i.e. the script will load when any page in the application has been loaded server-side).\n\n</PagesOnly>\n\n**This strategy should only be used for critical scripts that need to be fetched before any part of the page becomes interactive.**\n\n<AppOnly>\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/layout.tsx\" switcher\nimport Script from 'next/script'\n\nexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <body>\n        {children}\n        <Script\n          src=\"https://example.com/script.js\"\n          strategy=\"beforeInteractive\"\n        />\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/layout.js\" switcher\nimport Script from 'next/script'\n\nexport default function RootLayout({ children }) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <body>\n        {children}\n        <Script\n          src=\"https://example.com/script.js\"\n          strategy=\"beforeInteractive\"\n        />\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n</AppOnly>\n\n<PagesOnly>\n\n```jsx filename=\"pages/_document.js\"\nimport { Html, Head, Main, NextScript } from 'next/document'\nimport Script from 'next/script'\n\nexport default function Document() {\n  return (\n    <Html>\n      <Head />\n      <body>\n        <Main />\n        <NextScript />\n        <Script\n          src=\"https://example.com/script.js\"\n          strategy=\"beforeInteractive\"\n        />\n      </body>\n    </Html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n</PagesOnly>\n\n> **Good to know**: Scripts with `beforeInteractive` will always be injected inside the `head` of the HTML document regardless of where it's placed in the component.\n\nSome examples of scripts that should be loaded as soon as possible with `beforeInteractive` include:\n\n- Bot detectors\n- Cookie consent managers\n\n### `afterInteractive`\n\nScripts that use the `afterInteractive` strategy are injected into the HTML client-side and will load after some (or all) hydration occurs on the page. **This is the default strategy** of the Script component and should be used for any script that needs to load as soon as possible but not before any first-party Next.js code.\n\n`afterInteractive` scripts can be placed inside of any page or layout and will only load and execute when that page (or group of pages) is opened in the browser.\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/page.js\"\nimport Script from 'next/script'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Script src=\"https://example.com/script.js\" strategy=\"afterInteractive\" />\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nSome examples of scripts that are good candidates for `afterInteractive` include:\n\n- Tag managers\n- Analytics\n\n### `lazyOnload`\n\nScripts that use the `lazyOnload` strategy are injected into the HTML client-side during browser idle time and will load after all resources on the page have been fetched. This strategy should be used for any background or low priority scripts that do not need to load early.\n\n`lazyOnload` scripts can be placed inside of any page or layout and will only load and execute when that page (or group of pages) is opened in the browser.\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/page.js\"\nimport Script from 'next/script'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Script src=\"https://example.com/script.js\" strategy=\"lazyOnload\" />\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nExamples of scripts that do not need to load immediately and can be fetched with `lazyOnload` include:\n\n- Chat support plugins\n- Social media widgets\n\n### `worker`\n\n> **Warning:** The `worker` strategy is not yet stable and does not yet work with the [`app`](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/defining-routes) directory. Use with caution.\n\nScripts that use the `worker` strategy are off-loaded to a web worker in order to free up the main thread and ensure that only critical, first-party resources are processed on it. While this strategy can be used for any script, it is an advanced use case that is not guaranteed to support all third-party scripts.\n\nTo use `worker` as a strategy, the `nextScriptWorkers` flag must be enabled in `next.config.js`:\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  experimental: {\n    nextScriptWorkers: true,\n  },\n}\n```\n\n`worker` scripts can **only currently be used in the `pages/` directory**:\n\n```tsx filename=\"pages/home.tsx\" switcher\nimport Script from 'next/script'\n\nexport default function Home() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Script src=\"https://example.com/script.js\" strategy=\"worker\" />\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"pages/home.js\" switcher\nimport Script from 'next/script'\n\nexport default function Home() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Script src=\"https://example.com/script.js\" strategy=\"worker\" />\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### `onLoad`\n\n> **Warning:** `onLoad` does not yet work with Server Components and can only be used in Client Components. Further, `onLoad` can't be used with `beforeInteractive` – consider using `onReady` instead.\n\nSome third-party scripts require users to run JavaScript code once after the script has finished loading in order to instantiate content or call a function. If you are loading a script with either afterInteractive or lazyOnload as a loading strategy, you can execute code after it has loaded using the onLoad property.\n\nHere's an example of executing a lodash method only after the library has been loaded.\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/page.tsx\" switcher\n'use client'\n\nimport Script from 'next/script'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Script\n        src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/lodash.js/4.17.20/lodash.min.js\"\n        onLoad={() => {\n          console.log(_.sample([1, 2, 3, 4]))\n        }}\n      />\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/page.js\" switcher\n'use client'\n\nimport Script from 'next/script'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Script\n        src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/lodash.js/4.17.20/lodash.min.js\"\n        onLoad={() => {\n          console.log(_.sample([1, 2, 3, 4]))\n        }}\n      />\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### `onReady`\n\n> **Warning:** `onReady` does not yet work with Server Components and can only be used in Client Components.\n\nSome third-party scripts require users to run JavaScript code after the script has finished loading and every time the component is mounted (after a route navigation for example). You can execute code after the script's load event when it first loads and then after every subsequent component re-mount using the onReady property.\n\nHere's an example of how to re-instantiate a Google Maps JS embed every time the component is mounted:\n\n<AppOnly>\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/page.tsx\" switcher\n'use client'\n\nimport { useRef } from 'react'\nimport Script from 'next/script'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  const mapRef = useRef()\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <div ref={mapRef}></div>\n      <Script\n        id=\"google-maps\"\n        src=\"https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js\"\n        onReady={() => {\n          new google.maps.Map(mapRef.current, {\n            center: { lat: -34.397, lng: 150.644 },\n            zoom: 8,\n          })\n        }}\n      />\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/page.js\" switcher\n'use client'\n\nimport { useRef } from 'react'\nimport Script from 'next/script'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  const mapRef = useRef()\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <div ref={mapRef}></div>\n      <Script\n        id=\"google-maps\"\n        src=\"https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js\"\n        onReady={() => {\n          new google.maps.Map(mapRef.current, {\n            center: { lat: -34.397, lng: 150.644 },\n            zoom: 8,\n          })\n        }}\n      />\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n</AppOnly>\n\n<PagesOnly>\n\n```jsx\nimport { useRef } from 'react'\nimport Script from 'next/script'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  const mapRef = useRef()\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <div ref={mapRef}></div>\n      <Script\n        id=\"google-maps\"\n        src=\"https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js\"\n        onReady={() => {\n          new google.maps.Map(mapRef.current, {\n            center: { lat: -34.397, lng: 150.644 },\n            zoom: 8,\n          })\n        }}\n      />\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n</PagesOnly>\n\n### `onError`\n\n> **Warning:** `onError` does not yet work with Server Components and can only be used in Client Components. `onError` cannot be used with the `beforeInteractive` loading strategy.\n\nSometimes it is helpful to catch when a script fails to load. These errors can be handled with the onError property:\n\n<AppOnly>\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/page.tsx\" switcher\n'use client'\n\nimport Script from 'next/script'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Script\n        src=\"https://example.com/script.js\"\n        onError={(e: Error) => {\n          console.error('Script failed to load', e)\n        }}\n      />\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/page.js\" switcher\n'use client'\n\nimport Script from 'next/script'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Script\n        src=\"https://example.com/script.js\"\n        onError={(e: Error) => {\n          console.error('Script failed to load', e)\n        }}\n      />\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n</AppOnly>\n\n<PagesOnly>\n\n```jsx\nimport Script from 'next/script'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Script\n        src=\"https://example.com/script.js\"\n        onError={(e: Error) => {\n          console.error('Script failed to load', e)\n        }}\n      />\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n</PagesOnly>\n\n## Version History\n\n| Version   | Changes                                                                   |\n| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `v13.0.0` | `beforeInteractive` and `afterInteractive` is modified to support `app`.  |\n| `v12.2.4` | `onReady` prop added.                                                     |\n| `v12.2.2` | Allow `next/script` with `beforeInteractive` to be placed in `_document`. |\n| `v11.0.0` | `next/script` introduced.                                                 |\n"},{"path":"docs/02-app/02-api-reference/01-components/font.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/02-app/02-api-reference/01-components/font.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/components/font","sha":"35f5ac7266192cec7059940edf02f04c48fa9cff","size":14815,"content":"---\ntitle: Font Module\nnav_title: Font\ndescription: Optimizing loading web fonts with the built-in `next/font` loaders.\n---\n\n{/* The content of this doc is shared between the app and pages router.

It applies to `next/font/google` only.\n\nUsed in `next/font/google` and `next/font/local`\n\n- Optional\n\nExamples:\n\n- `style: 'italic'`: A string - it can be `normal` or `italic` for `next/font/google`\n- `style: 'oblique'`: A string - it can take any value for `next/font/local` but is expected to come from [standard font styles](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/font-style)\n- `style: ['italic','normal']`: An array of 2 values for `next/font/google` - the values are from `normal` and `italic`\n\n### `subsets`\n\nThe font [`subsets`](https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/subsetting) defined by an array of string values with the names of each subset you would like to be [preloaded](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts#specifying-a-subset). Fonts specified via `subsets` will have a link preload tag injected into the head when the [`preload`](#preload) option is true, which is the default.\n\nUsed in `next/font/google`\n\n- Optional\n\nExamples:\n\n- `subsets: ['latin']`: An array with the subset `latin`\n\nYou can find a list of all subsets on the Google Fonts page for your font.\n\n### `axes`\n\nSome variable fonts have extra `axes` that can be included.

The default is `true`.\n- For `next/font/local`: A string or boolean `false` value that sets whether an automatic fallback font should be used to reduce [Cumulative Layout Shift](https://web.dev/cls/). The possible values are `'Arial'`, `'Times New Roman'` or `false`. The default is `'Arial'`.\n\nUsed in `next/font/google` and `next/font/local`\n\n- Optional\n\nExamples:\n\n- `adjustFontFallback: false`: for `next/font/google`\n- `adjustFontFallback: 'Times New Roman'`: for `next/font/local`\n\n### `variable`\n\nA string value to define the CSS variable name to be used if the style is applied with the [CSS variable method](#css-variables).\n\nUsed in `next/font/google` and `next/font/local`\n\n- Optional\n\nExamples:\n\n- `variable: '--my-font'`: The CSS variable `--my-font` is declared\n\n### `declarations`\n\nAn array of font face [descriptor](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face#descriptors) key-value pairs that define the generated `@font-face` further.\n\nUsed in `next/font/local`\n\n- Optional\n\nExamples:\n\n- `declarations: [{ prop: 'ascent-override', value: '90%' }]`\n\n## Applying Styles\n\nYou can apply the font styles in three ways:\n\n- [`className`](#classname)\n- [`style`](#style-1)\n- [CSS Variables](#css-variables)\n\n### `className`\n\nReturns a read-only CSS `className` for the loaded font to be passed to an HTML element.\n\n```tsx\n<p className={inter.className}>Hello, Next.js!</p>\n```\n\n### `style`\n\nReturns a read-only CSS `style` object for the loaded font to be passed to an HTML element, including `style.fontFamily` to access the font family name and fallback fonts.\n\n```tsx\n<p style={inter.style}>Hello World</p>\n```\n\n### CSS Variables\n\nIf you would like to set your styles in an external style sheet and specify additional options there, use the CSS variable method.\n\nIn addition to importing the font, also import the CSS file where the CSS variable is defined and set the variable option of the font loader object as follows:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/page.tsx\" switcher\nimport { Inter } from 'next/font/google'\nimport styles from '../styles/component.module.css'\n\nconst inter = Inter({\n  variable: '--font-inter',\n})\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/page.js\" switcher\nimport { Inter } from 'next/font/google'\nimport styles from '../styles/component.module.css'\n\nconst inter = Inter({\n  variable: '--font-inter',\n})\n```\n\nTo use the font, set the `className` of the parent container of the text you would like to style to the font loader's `variable` value and the `className` of the text to the `styles` property from the external CSS file.\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/page.tsx\" switcher\n<main className={inter.variable}>\n  <p className={styles.text}>Hello World</p>\n</main>\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/page.js\" switcher\n<main className={inter.variable}>\n  <p className={styles.text}>Hello World</p>\n</main>\n```\n\nDefine the `text` selector class in the `component.module.css` CSS file as follows:\n\n```css filename=\"styles/component.module.css\"\n.text {\n  font-family: var(--font-inter);\n  font-weight: 200;\n  font-style: italic;\n}\n```\n\nIn the example above, the text `Hello World` is styled using the `Inter` font and the generated font fallback with `font-weight: 200` and `font-style: italic`.\n\n## Using a font definitions file\n\nEvery time you call the `localFont` or Google font function, that font will be hosted as one instance in your application. Therefore, if you need to use the same font in multiple places, you should load it in one place and import the related font object where you need it. This is done using a font definitions file.\n\nFor example, create a `fonts.ts` file in a `styles` folder at the root of your app directory.\n\nThen, specify your font definitions as follows:\n\n```ts filename=\"styles/fonts.ts\" switcher\nimport { Inter, Lora, Source_Sans_3 } from 'next/font/google'\nimport localFont from 'next/font/local'\n\n// define your variable fonts\nconst inter = Inter()\nconst lora = Lora()\n// define 2 weights of a non-variable font\nconst sourceCodePro400 = Source_Sans_3({ weight: '400' })\nconst sourceCodePro700 = Source_Sans_3({ weight: '700' })\n// define a custom local font where GreatVibes-Regular.ttf is stored in the styles folder\nconst greatVibes = localFont({ src: './GreatVibes-Regular.ttf' })\n\nexport { inter, lora, sourceCodePro400, sourceCodePro700, greatVibes }\n```\n\n```js filename=\"styles/fonts.js\" switcher\nimport { Inter, Lora, Source_Sans_3 } from 'next/font/google'\nimport localFont from 'next/font/local'\n\n// define your variable fonts\nconst inter = Inter()\nconst lora = Lora()\n// define 2 weights of a non-variable font\nconst sourceCodePro400 = Source_Sans_3({ weight: '400' })\nconst sourceCodePro700 = Source_Sans_3({ weight: '700' })\n// define a custom local font where GreatVibes-Regular.ttf is stored in the styles folder\nconst greatVibes = localFont({ src: './GreatVibes-Regular.ttf' })\n\nexport { inter, lora, sourceCodePro400, sourceCodePro700, greatVibes }\n```\n\nYou can now use these definitions in your code as follows:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/page.tsx\" switcher\nimport { inter, lora, sourceCodePro700, greatVibes } from '../styles/fonts'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <p className={inter.className}>Hello world using Inter font</p>\n      <p style={lora.style}>Hello world using Lora font</p>\n      <p className={sourceCodePro700.className}>\n        Hello world using Source_Sans_3 font with weight 700\n      </p>\n      <p className={greatVibes.className}>My title in Great Vibes font</p>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/page.js\" switcher\nimport { inter, lora, sourceCodePro700, greatVibes } from '../styles/fonts'\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <p className={inter.className}>Hello world using Inter font</p>\n      <p style={lora.style}>Hello world using Lora font</p>\n      <p className={sourceCodePro700.className}>\n        Hello world using Source_Sans_3 font with weight 700\n      </p>\n      <p className={greatVibes.className}>My title in Great Vibes font</p>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nTo make it easier to access the font definitions in your code, you can define a path alias in your `tsconfig.json` or `jsconfig.json` files as follows:\n\n```json filename=\"tsconfig.json\"\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"paths\": {\n      \"@/fonts\": [\"./styles/fonts\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nYou can now import any font definition as follows:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/about/page.tsx\" switcher\nimport { greatVibes, sourceCodePro400 } from '@/fonts'\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/about/page.js\" switcher\nimport { greatVibes, sourceCodePro400 } from '@/fonts'\n```\n\n## Version Changes\n\n| Version   | Changes                                                               |\n| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `v13.2.0` | `@next/font` renamed to `next/font`.

The following [HTTP methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods) are supported: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`, `HEAD`, and `OPTIONS`.\n\n```ts filename=\"route.ts\" switcher\nexport async function GET(request: Request) {}\n\nexport async function HEAD(request: Request) {}\n\nexport async function POST(request: Request) {}\n\nexport async function PUT(request: Request) {}\n\nexport async function DELETE(request: Request) {}\n\nexport async function PATCH(request: Request) {}\n\n// If `OPTIONS` is not defined, Next.js will automatically implement `OPTIONS` and  set the appropriate Response `Allow` header depending on the other methods defined in the route handler.\nexport async function OPTIONS(request: Request) {}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"route.js\" switcher\nexport async function GET(request) {}\n\nexport async function HEAD(request) {}\n\nexport async function POST(request) {}\n\nexport async function PUT(request) {}\n\nexport async function DELETE(request) {}\n\nexport async function PATCH(request) {}\n\n// If `OPTIONS` is not defined, Next.js will automatically implement `OPTIONS` and  set the appropriate Response `Allow` header depending on the other methods defined in the route handler.\nexport async function OPTIONS(request) {}\n```\n\n> **Good to know**: Route Handlers are only available inside the App Router. You **do not** need to use API Routes (`pages`) and Route Handlers (`app`) together, as Route Handlers should be able to handle all use cases.\n\n## Parameters\n\n### `request` (optional)\n\nThe `request` object is a [NextRequest](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/next-request) object, which is an extension of the Web [Request](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Request) API. `NextRequest` gives you further control over the incoming request, including easily accessing `cookies` and an extended, parsed, URL object `nextUrl`.\n\n### `context` (optional)\n\n```ts filename=\"app/dashboard/[team]/route.ts\" switcher\ntype Params = {\n  team: string\n}\n\nexport async function GET(request: Request, context: { params: Params }) {\n  const team = context.params.team // '1'\n}\n\n// Define params type according to your route parameters (see table below)\n```\n\n```js filename=\"app/dashboard/[team]/route.js\" switcher\n\nexport async function GET(request, context: { params }) {\n  const team = context.params.team // '1'\n}\n\n```\n\nCurrently, the only value of `context` is `params`, which is an object containing the [dynamic route parameters](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes) for the current route.\n\n| Example                          | URL            | `params`                  |\n| -------------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------- |\n| `app/dashboard/[team]/route.js`  | `/dashboard/1` | `{ team: '1' }`           |\n| `app/shop/[tag]/[item]/route.js` | `/shop/1/2`    | `{ tag: '1', item: '2' }` |\n| `app/blog/[...slug]/route.js`    | `/blog/1/2`    | `{ slug: ['1', '2'] }`    |\n\n## NextResponse\n\nRoute Handlers can extend the Web Response API by returning a `NextResponse` object. This allows you to easily set cookies, headers, redirect, and rewrite. [View the API reference](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/next-response).\n\n## Version History\n\n| Version   | Changes                                                                   |\n| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `v15.0.0` | The default caching for `GET` handlers was changed from static to dynamic |\n| `v13.2.0` | Route Handlers are introduced.                                            |\n"},{"path":"docs/02-app/02-api-reference/02-file-conventions/layout.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/02-app/02-api-reference/02-file-conventions/layout.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/layout","sha":"df018a00dd3388dfc4b25f9d533b16d242f7001e","size":7520,"content":"---\ntitle: layout.js\ndescription: API reference for the layout.js file.\n---\n\nA **layout** is UI that is shared between routes.\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/dashboard/layout.tsx\" switcher\nexport default function DashboardLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return <section>{children}</section>\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/dashboard/layout.js\" switcher\nexport default function DashboardLayout({ children }) {\n  return <section>{children}</section>\n}\n```\n\nA **root layout** is the top-most layout in the root `app` directory.

During rendering, `children` will be populated with the route segments the layout is wrapping. These will primarily be the component of a child [Layout](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/pages) (if it exists) or [Page](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/pages), but could also be other special files like [Loading](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/loading-ui-and-streaming) or [Error](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/error-handling) when applicable.\n\n### `params` (optional)\n\nThe [dynamic route parameters](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes) object from the root segment down to that layout.\n\n| Example                           | URL            | `params`                  |\n| --------------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------- |\n| `app/dashboard/[team]/layout.js`  | `/dashboard/1` | `{ team: '1' }`           |\n| `app/shop/[tag]/[item]/layout.js` | `/shop/1/2`    | `{ tag: '1', item: '2' }` |\n| `app/blog/[...slug]/layout.js`    | `/blog/1/2`    | `{ slug: ['1', '2'] }`    |\n\nFor example:\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/shop/[tag]/[item]/layout.tsx\" switcher\nexport default function ShopLayout({\n  children,\n  params,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n  params: {\n    tag: string\n    item: string\n  }\n}) {\n  // URL -> /shop/shoes/nike-air-max-97\n  // `params` -> { tag: 'shoes', item: 'nike-air-max-97' }\n  return <section>{children}</section>\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/shop/[tag]/[item]/layout.js\" switcher\nexport default function ShopLayout({ children, params }) {\n  // URL -> /shop/shoes/nike-air-max-97\n  // `params` -> { tag: 'shoes', item: 'nike-air-max-97' }\n  return <section>{children}</section>\n}\n```\n\n## Good to know\n\n### Root Layouts\n\n- The `app` directory **must** include a root `app/layout.js`.\n- The root layout **must** define `<html>` and `<body>` tags.\n  - You should **not** manually add `<head>` tags such as `<title>` and `<meta>` to root layouts. Instead, you should use the [Metadata API](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-metadata) which automatically handles advanced requirements such as streaming and de-duplicating `<head>` elements.\n- You can use [route groups](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-groups) to create multiple root layouts.\n  - Navigating **across multiple root layouts** will cause a **full page load** (as opposed to a client-side navigation). For example, navigating from `/cart` that uses `app/(shop)/layout.js` to `/blog` that uses `app/(marketing)/layout.js` will cause a full page load. This **only** applies to multiple root layouts.\n\n### Layouts do not receive `searchParams`\n\nUnlike [Pages](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/page), Layout components **do not** receive the `searchParams` prop. This is because a shared layout is [not re-rendered during navigation](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/linking-and-navigating#4-partial-rendering) which could lead to stale `searchParams` between navigations.\n\nWhen using client-side navigation, Next.js automatically only renders the part of the page below the common layout between two routes.\n\nFor example, in the following directory structure, `dashboard/layout.tsx` is the common layout for both `/dashboard/settings` and `/dashboard/analytics`:\n\n<Image\n  alt=\"File structure showing a dashboard folder nesting a layout.tsx file, and settings and analytics folders with their own pages\"\n  srcLight=\"/docs/light/shared-dashboard-layout.png\"\n  srcDark=\"/docs/dark/shared-dashboard-layout.png\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"687\"\n/>\n\nWhen navigating from `/dashboard/settings` to `/dashboard/analytics`, `page.tsx` in `/dashboard/analytics` will rerender on the server, while `dashboard/layout.tsx` will **not** rerender because it's a common UI shared between the two routes.\n\nThis performance optimization allows navigation between pages that share a layout to be quicker as only the data fetching and rendering for the page has to run, instead of the entire route that could include shared layouts that fetch their own data.\n\nBecause `dashboard/layout.tsx` doesn't re-render, the `searchParams` prop in the layout Server Component might become **stale** after navigation.\n\nInstead, use the Page [`searchParams`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/page#searchparams-optional) prop or the [`useSearchParams`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-search-params) hook in a Client Component, which is re-rendered on the client with the latest `searchParams`.\n\n### Layouts cannot access `pathname`\n\nLayouts cannot access `pathname`. This is because layouts are Server Components by default, and [don't rerender during client-side navigation](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/linking-and-navigating#4-partial-rendering), which could lead to `pathname` becoming stale between navigations. To prevent staleness, Next.js would need to refetch all segments of a route, losing the benefits of caching and increasing the [RSC payload](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components#what-is-the-react-server-component-payload-rsc) size on navigation.\n\nInstead, you can extract the logic that depends on pathname into a Client Component and import it into your layouts. Since Client Components rerender (but are not refetched) during navigation, you can use Next.js hooks such as [`usePathname`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-pathname) to access the current pathname and prevent staleness.\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/dashboard/layout.tsx\" switcher\nimport { ClientComponent } from '@/app/ui/ClientComponent'\n\nexport default function Layout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <ClientComponent />\n      {/* Other Layout UI */}\n      <main>{children}</main>\n    <>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/dashboard/layout.js\" switcher\nimport { ClientComponent } from '@/app/ui/ClientComponent'\n\nexport default function Layout({ children }) {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <ClientComponent />\n      {/* Other Layout UI */}\n      <main>{children}</main>\n    <>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nCommon `pathname` patterns can also be implemented with [`params`](#params-optional) prop.\n\nSee the [examples](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/layouts-and-templates#examples) section for more information.\n\n## Version History\n\n| Version   | Changes              |\n| --------- | -------------------- |\n| `v13.0.0` | `layout` introduced. |\n"},{"path":"docs/02-app/02-api-reference/02-file-conventions/default.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/02-app/02-api-reference/02-file-conventions/default.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/default","sha":"b1275af15d81783e8d5cec15f9855480b6411b8f","size":2248,"content":"---\ntitle: default.js\ndescription: API Reference for the default.js file.\nrelated:\n  title: Learn more about Parallel Routes\n  links:\n    - app/building-your-application/routing/parallel-routes\n---\n\nThe `default.js` file is used to render a fallback within [Parallel Routes](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/parallel-routes) when Next.js cannot recover a [slot's](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/parallel-routes#slots) active state after a full-page load.\n\nDuring [soft navigation](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/linking-and-navigating#5-soft-navigation), Next.js keeps track of the active _state_ (subpage) for each slot. However, for hard navigations (full-page load), Next.js cannot recover the active state. In this case, a `default.js` file can be rendered for subpages that don't match the current URL.\n\nConsider the following folder structure. The `@team` slot has a `settings` page, but `@analytics` does not.\n\n<Image\n  alt=\"Parallel Routes unmatched routes\"\n  srcLight=\"/docs/light/parallel-routes-unmatched-routes.png\"\n  srcDark=\"/docs/dark/parallel-routes-unmatched-routes.png\"\n  width=\"1600\"\n  height=\"930\"\n/>\n\nWhen navigating to `/settings`, the `@team` slot will render the `settings` page while maintaining the currently active page for the `@analytics` slot.\n\nOn refresh, Next.js will render a `default.js` for `@analytics`. If `default.js` doesn't exist, a `404` is rendered instead.\n\nAdditionally, since `children` is an implicit slot, you also need to create a `default.js` file to render a fallback for `children` when Next.js cannot recover the active state of the parent page.\n\n## Props\n\n### `params` (optional)\n\nAn object containing the [dynamic route parameters](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes) from the root segment down to the slot's subpages.

Then, based on the incoming request, you can modify the response by rewriting, redirecting, modifying the request or response headers, or responding directly.\n\nMiddleware executes before routes are rendered. It's particularly useful for implementing custom server-side logic like authentication, logging, or handling redirects.\n\nUse the file `middleware.ts` (or .js) in the root of your project to define Middleware. For example, at the same level as `app` or `pages`, or inside `src` if applicable.\n\n```tsx filename=\"middleware.ts\" switcher\nimport { NextResponse, NextRequest } from 'next/server'\n\n// This function can be marked `async` if using `await` inside\nexport function middleware(request: NextRequest) {\n  return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/home', request.url))\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: '/about/:path*',\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"middleware.js\" switcher\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n\n// This function can be marked `async` if using `await` inside\nexport function middleware(request) {\n  return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/home', request.url))\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: '/about/:path*',\n}\n```\n\n## Exports\n\n### Middleware function\n\nThe file must export a single function, either as a default export or named `middleware`. Note that multiple middleware from the same file are not supported.\n\n```js filename=\"middleware.js\"\n// Example of default export\nexport default function middleware(request) {\n  // Middleware logic\n}\n```\n\n### Config object (optional)\n\nOptionally, a config object can be exported alongside the Middleware function. This object includes the [matcher](#matcher) to specify paths where the Middleware applies.\n\n#### Matcher\n\nThe `matcher` option allows you to target specific paths for the Middleware to run on. You can specify these paths in several ways:\n\n- For a single path: Directly use a string to define the path, like `'/about'`.\n- For multiple paths: Use an array to list multiple paths, such as `matcher: ['/about', '/contact']`, which applies the Middleware to both `/about` and `/contact`.\n\nAdditionally, `matcher` supports complex path specifications through regular expressions, such as `matcher: ['/((?!api|_next/static|_next/image|.*\\\\.png$).*)']`, enabling precise control over which paths to include or exclude.\n\nThe `matcher` option also accepts an array of objects with the following keys:\n\n- `source`: The path or pattern used to match the request paths. It can be a string for direct path matching or a pattern for more complex matching.\n- `regexp` (optional): A regular expression string that fine-tunes the matching based on the source. It provides additional control over which paths are included or excluded.\n- `locale` (optional): A boolean that, when set to `false`, ignores locale-based routing in path matching.\n- `has` (optional): Specifies conditions based on the presence of specific request elements such as headers, query parameters, or cookies.\n- `missing` (optional): Focuses on conditions where certain request elements are absent, like missing headers or cookies.\n\n```js filename=\"middleware.js\"\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: [\n    {\n      source: '/api/*',\n      regexp: '^/api/(.*)',\n      locale: false,\n      has: [\n        { type: 'header', key: 'Authorization', value: 'Bearer Token' },\n        { type: 'query', key: 'userId', value: '123' },\n      ],\n      missing: [{ type: 'cookie', key: 'session', value: 'active' }],\n    },\n  ],\n}\n```\n\n## Params\n\n### `request`\n\nWhen defining Middleware, the default export function accepts a single parameter, `request`. This parameter is an instance of `NextRequest`, which represents the incoming HTTP request.\n\n```tsx filename=\"middleware.ts\" switcher\nimport type { NextRequest } from 'next/server'\n\nexport function middleware(request: NextRequest) {\n  // Middleware logic goes here\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"middleware.js\" switcher\nexport function middleware(request) {\n  // Middleware logic goes here\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know**:\n>\n> - `NextRequest` is a type that represents incoming HTTP requests in Next.js Middleware, whereas [`NextResponse`](#nextresponse) is a class used to manipulate and send back HTTP responses.\n\n## NextResponse\n\nMiddleware can use the [`NextResponse`](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware#nextresponse) object which extends the [Web Response API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response). By returning a `NextResponse` object, you can directly manipulate cookies, set headers, implement redirects, and rewrite paths.\n\n> **Good to know**: For redirects, you can also use `Response.redirect` instead of `NextResponse.redirect`.\n\n## Runtime\n\nMiddleware only supports the [Edge runtime](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/edge-and-nodejs-runtimes). The Node.js runtime cannot be used.\n\n## Version History\n\n| Version   | Changes                                                                                       |\n| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `v13.1.0` | Advanced Middleware flags added                                                               |\n| `v13.0.0` | Middleware can modify request headers, response headers, and send responses                   |\n| `v12.2.0` | Middleware is stable, please see the [upgrade guide](/docs/messages/middleware-upgrade-guide) |\n| `v12.0.9` | Enforce absolute URLs in Edge Runtime ([PR](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/33410))    |\n| `v12.0.0` | Middleware (Beta) added                                                                       |\n"},{"path":"docs/02-app/02-api-reference/02-file-conventions/route-segment-config.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/02-app/02-api-reference/02-file-conventions/route-segment-config.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/route-segment-config","sha":"0c00300a976635b4c91a9212e90161a31942c047","size":15041,"content":"---\ntitle: Route Segment Config\ndescription: Learn about how to configure options for Next.js route segments.\n---\n\nThe Route Segment options allows you to configure the behavior of a [Page](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/layouts-and-templates), [Layout](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/layouts-and-templates), or [Route Handler](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-handlers) by directly exporting the following variables:\n\n| Option                                | Type                                                                                                                      | Default                    |\n| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |\n| [`experimental_ppr`](#dynamic)        | `'true' \\| 'false'`                                                                                                       |\n| [`dynamic`](#dynamic)                 | `'auto' \\| 'force-dynamic' \\| 'error' \\| 'force-static'`                                                                  | `'auto'`                   |\n| [`dynamicParams`](#dynamicparams)     | `boolean`                                                                                                                 | `true`                     |\n| [`revalidate`](#revalidate)           | `false \\| 0 \\| number`                                                                                                    | `false`                    |\n| [`fetchCache`](#fetchcache)           | `'auto' \\| 'default-cache' \\| 'only-cache' \\| 'force-cache' \\| 'force-no-store' \\| 'default-no-store' \\| 'only-no-store'` | `'auto'`                   |\n| [`runtime`](#runtime)                 | `'nodejs' \\| 'edge'`                                                                                                      | `'nodejs'`                 |\n| [`preferredRegion`](#preferredregion) | `'auto' \\| 'global' \\| 'home' \\| string \\| string[]`                                                                      | `'auto'`                   |\n| [`maxDuration`](#maxduration)         | `number`                                                                                                                  | Set by deployment platform |\n\n## Options\n\n### `experimental_ppr`\n\nEnable [Partial Prerendering (PPR)](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/partial-prerendering) for a layout or page.\n\n```tsx filename=\"layout.tsx | page.tsx \" switcher\nexport const experimental_ppr = true\n// true | false\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"layout.js | page.js \" switcher\nexport const experimental_ppr = true\n// true | false\n```\n\n### `dynamic`\n\nChange the dynamic behavior of a layout or page to fully static or fully dynamic.\n\n```tsx filename=\"layout.tsx | page.tsx | route.ts\" switcher\nexport const dynamic = 'auto'\n// 'auto' | 'force-dynamic' | 'error' | 'force-static'\n```\n\n```js filename=\"layout.js | page.js | route.js\" switcher\nexport const dynamic = 'auto'\n// 'auto' | 'force-dynamic' | 'error' | 'force-static'\n```\n\n> **Good to know**: The new model in the `app` directory favors granular caching control at the `fetch` request level over the binary all-or-nothing model of `getServerSideProps` and `getStaticProps` at the page-level in the `pages` directory. The `dynamic` option is a way to opt back in to the previous model as a convenience and provides a simpler migration path.\n\n- **`'auto'`** (default): The default option to cache as much as possible without preventing any components from opting into dynamic behavior.\n- **`'force-dynamic'`**: Force [dynamic rendering](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components#dynamic-rendering), which will result in routes being rendered for each user at request time. This option is equivalent to:\n\n  - `getServerSideProps()` in the `pages` directory.\n  - Setting the option of every `fetch()` request in a layout or page to `{ cache: 'no-store', next: { revalidate: 0 } }`.\n  - Setting the segment config to `export const fetchCache = 'force-no-store'`\n\n- **`'error'`**: Force static rendering and cache the data of a layout or page by causing an error if any components use [dynamic functions](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components#dynamic-functions) or uncached data. This option is equivalent to:\n  - `getStaticProps()` in the `pages` directory.\n  - Setting the option of every `fetch()` request in a layout or page to `{ cache: 'force-cache' }`.\n  - Setting the segment config to `fetchCache = 'only-cache', dynamicParams = false`.\n  - `dynamic = 'error'` changes the default of `dynamicParams` from `true` to `false`. You can opt back into dynamically rendering pages for dynamic params not generated by `generateStaticParams` by manually setting `dynamicParams = true`.\n- **`'force-static'`**: Force static rendering and cache the data of a layout or page by forcing [`cookies()`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/cookies), [`headers()`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/headers) and [`useSearchParams()`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-search-params) to return empty values.\n\n> **Good to know**:\n>\n> - Instructions on [how to migrate](/docs/app/building-your-application/upgrading/app-router-migration#step-6-migrating-data-fetching-methods) from `getServerSideProps` and `getStaticProps` to `dynamic: 'force-dynamic'` and `dynamic: 'error'` can be found in the [upgrade guide](/docs/app/building-your-application/upgrading/app-router-migration#step-6-migrating-data-fetching-methods).\n\n### `dynamicParams`\n\nControl what happens when a dynamic segment is visited that was not generated with [generateStaticParams](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-static-params).\n\n```tsx filename=\"layout.tsx | page.tsx\" switcher\nexport const dynamicParams = true // true | false,\n```\n\n```js filename=\"layout.js | page.js | route.js\" switcher\nexport const dynamicParams = true // true | false,\n```\n\n- **`true`** (default): Dynamic segments not included in `generateStaticParams` are generated on demand.\n- **`false`**: Dynamic segments not included in `generateStaticParams` will return a 404.\n\n> **Good to know**:\n>\n> - This option replaces the `fallback: true | false | blocking` option of `getStaticPaths` in the `pages` directory.\n> - When `dynamicParams = true`, the segment uses [Streaming Server Rendering](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/loading-ui-and-streaming#streaming-with-suspense).\n> - If the `dynamic = 'error'` and `dynamic = 'force-static'` are used, it'll change the default of `dynamicParams` to `false`.\n\n### `revalidate`\n\nSet the default revalidation time for a layout or page. This option does not override the `revalidate` value set by individual `fetch` requests.\n\n```tsx filename=\"layout.tsx | page.tsx | route.ts\" switcher\nexport const revalidate = false\n// false | 0 | number\n```\n\n```js filename=\"layout.js | page.js | route.js\" switcher\nexport const revalidate = false\n// false | 0 | number\n```\n\n- **`false`** (default): The default heuristic to cache any `fetch` requests that set their `cache` option to `'force-cache'` or are discovered before a [dynamic function](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components#server-rendering-strategies#dynamic-functions) is used. Semantically equivalent to `revalidate: Infinity` which effectively means the resource should be cached indefinitely. It is still possible for individual `fetch` requests to use `cache: 'no-store'` or `revalidate: 0` to avoid being cached and make the route dynamically rendered. Or set `revalidate` to a positive number lower than the route default to increase the revalidation frequency of a route.\n- **`0`**: Ensure a layout or page is always [dynamically rendered](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components#dynamic-rendering) even if no dynamic functions or uncached data fetches are discovered. This option changes the default of `fetch` requests that do not set a `cache` option to `'no-store'` but leaves `fetch` requests that opt into `'force-cache'` or use a positive `revalidate` as is.\n- **`number`**: (in seconds) Set the default revalidation frequency of a layout or page to `n` seconds.\n\n> **Good to know**:\n>\n> - The revalidate value needs to be statically analyzable. For example `revalidate = 600` is valid, but `revalidate = 60 * 10` is not.\n> - The revalidate value is not available when using `runtime = 'edge'`.\n\n#### Revalidation Frequency\n\n- The lowest `revalidate` across each layout and page of a single route will determine the revalidation frequency of the _entire_ route. This ensures that child pages are revalidated as frequently as their parent layouts.\n- Individual `fetch` requests can set a lower `revalidate` than the route's default `revalidate` to increase the revalidation frequency of the entire route. This allows you to dynamically opt-in to more frequent revalidation for certain routes based on some criteria.\n\n### `fetchCache`\n\n<details>\n  <summary>This is an advanced option that should only be used if you specifically need to override the default behavior.</summary>\n\nBy default, Next.js **will cache** any `fetch()` requests that are reachable **before** any [dynamic functions](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components#server-rendering-strategies#dynamic-functions) are used and **will not cache** `fetch` requests that are discovered **after** dynamic functions are used.\n\n`fetchCache` allows you to override the default `cache` option of all `fetch` requests in a layout or page.\n\n```tsx filename=\"layout.tsx | page.tsx | route.ts\" switcher\nexport const fetchCache = 'auto'\n// 'auto' | 'default-cache' | 'only-cache'\n// 'force-cache' | 'force-no-store' | 'default-no-store' | 'only-no-store'\n```\n\n```js filename=\"layout.js | page.js | route.js\" switcher\nexport const fetchCache = 'auto'\n// 'auto' | 'default-cache' | 'only-cache'\n// 'force-cache' | 'force-no-store' | 'default-no-store' | 'only-no-store'\n```\n\n- **`'auto'`** (default): The default option to cache `fetch` requests before dynamic functions with the `cache` option they provide and not cache `fetch` requests after dynamic functions.\n- **`'default-cache'`**: Allow any `cache` option to be passed to `fetch` but if no option is provided then set the `cache` option to `'force-cache'`. This means that even `fetch` requests after dynamic functions are considered static.\n- **`'only-cache'`**: Ensure all `fetch` requests opt into caching by changing the default to `cache: 'force-cache'` if no option is provided and causing an error if any `fetch` requests use `cache: 'no-store'`.\n- **`'force-cache'`**: Ensure all `fetch` requests opt into caching by setting the `cache` option of all `fetch` requests to `'force-cache'`.\n- **`'default-no-store'`**: Allow any `cache` option to be passed to `fetch` but if no option is provided then set the `cache` option to `'no-store'`. This means that even `fetch` requests before dynamic functions are considered dynamic.\n- **`'only-no-store'`**: Ensure all `fetch` requests opt out of caching by changing the default to `cache: 'no-store'` if no option is provided and causing an error if any `fetch` requests use `cache: 'force-cache'`\n- **`'force-no-store'`**: Ensure all `fetch` requests opt out of caching by setting the `cache` option of all `fetch` requests to `'no-store'`. This forces all `fetch` requests to be re-fetched every request even if they provide a `'force-cache'` option.\n\n#### Cross-route segment behavior\n\n- Any options set across each layout and page of a single route need to be compatible with each other.\n  - If both the `'only-cache'` and `'force-cache'` are provided, then `'force-cache'` wins. If both `'only-no-store'` and `'force-no-store'` are provided, then `'force-no-store'` wins. The force option changes the behavior across the route so a single segment with `'force-*'` would prevent any errors caused by `'only-*'`.\n  - The intention of the `'only-*'` and `force-*'` options is to guarantee the whole route is either fully static or fully dynamic. This means:\n    - A combination of `'only-cache'` and `'only-no-store'` in a single route is not allowed.\n    - A combination of `'force-cache'` and `'force-no-store'` in a single route is not allowed.\n  - A parent cannot provide `'default-no-store'` if a child provides `'auto'` or `'*-cache'` since that could make the same fetch have different behavior.\n- It is generally recommended to leave shared parent layouts as `'auto'` and customize the options where child segments diverge.\n\n</details>\n\n### `runtime`\n\nWe recommend using the Node.js runtime for rendering your application, and the Edge runtime for Middleware (only supported option).\n\n```tsx filename=\"layout.tsx | page.tsx | route.ts\" switcher\nexport const runtime = 'nodejs'\n// 'nodejs' | 'edge'\n```\n\n```js filename=\"layout.js | page.js | route.js\" switcher\nexport const runtime = 'nodejs'\n// 'nodejs' | 'edge'\n```\n\n- **`'nodejs'`** (default)\n- **`'edge'`**\n\nLearn more about the [different runtimes](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/edge-and-nodejs-runtimes).\n\n### `preferredRegion`\n\n```tsx filename=\"layout.tsx | page.tsx | route.ts\" switcher\nexport const preferredRegion = 'auto'\n// 'auto' | 'global' | 'home' | ['iad1', 'sfo1']\n```\n\n```js filename=\"layout.js | page.js | route.js\" switcher\nexport const preferredRegion = 'auto'\n// 'auto' | 'global' | 'home' | ['iad1', 'sfo1']\n```\n\nSupport for `preferredRegion`, and regions supported, is dependent on your deployment platform.\n\n> **Good to know**:\n>\n> - If a `preferredRegion` is not specified, it will inherit the option of the nearest parent layout.\n> - The root layout defaults to `all` regions.\n\n### `maxDuration`\n\nBy default, Next.js does not limit the execution of server-side logic (rendering a page or handling an API).\nDeployment platforms can use `maxDuration` from the Next.js build output to add specific execution limits.\nFor example, on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/serverless-functions/runtimes#max-duration).\n\n**Note**: This settings requires Next.js `13.4.10` or higher.\n\n```tsx filename=\"layout.tsx | page.tsx | route.ts\" switcher\nexport const maxDuration = 5\n```\n\n```js filename=\"layout.js | page.js | route.js\" switcher\nexport const maxDuration = 5\n```\n\n> **Good to know**:\n>\n> - If using [Server Actions](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions-and-mutations), set the `maxDuration` at the page level to change the default timeout of all Server Actions used on the page.\n\n### `generateStaticParams`\n\nThe `generateStaticParams` function can be used in combination with [dynamic route segments](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes) to define the list of route segment parameters that will be statically generated at build time instead of on-demand at request time.\n\nSee the [API reference](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-static-params) for more details.\n"},{"path":"docs/02-app/02-api-reference/02-file-conventions/loading.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/02-app/02-api-reference/02-file-conventions/loading.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/loading","sha":"2cded0f20bab854a35fa49ed925cdff99783f891","size":1130,"content":"---\ntitle: loading.js\ndescription: API reference for the loading.js  file.\n---\n\nA **loading** file can create instant loading states built on [Suspense](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/loading-ui-and-streaming).\n\nBy default, this file is a [Server Component](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components) -

`params` (optional)\n\nAn object containing the [dynamic route parameters](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes) object from the root segment down to the segment `opengraph-image` or `twitter-image` is colocated in.\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/shop/[slug]/opengraph-image.tsx\" switcher\nexport default function Image({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }) {\n

`app/shop/[...slug]/opengraph-image.js`    | `/shop/1/2` | `{ slug: ['1', '2'] }`    |\n\n### Returns\n\nThe default export function should return a `Blob` | `ArrayBuffer` | `TypedArray` | `DataView` | `ReadableStream` | `Response`.\n\n> **Good to know**: `ImageResponse` satisfies this return type.\n\n### Config exports\n\nYou can optionally configure the image's metadata by exporting `alt`, `size`, and `contentType` variables from `opengraph-image` or `twitter-image` route.\n\n| Option                        | Type

Handlers](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-handlers) that can use the same [route segment configuration](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/route-segment-config) options as Pages and Layouts.\n\n### Examples\n\n#### Using external data\n\nThis example uses the `params` object and external data to generate the image.\n\n> **Good to know**:\n> By default, this generated image will be [statically optimized](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components#static-rendering-default). You can configure the individual `fetch` [`options`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/fetch) or route segments [options](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/route-segment-config#revalidate) to change this behavior.\n\n```tsx filename=\"app/posts/[slug]/opengraph-image.tsx\" switcher\nimport { ImageResponse } from 'next/og'\n\nexport const alt = 'About Acme'\nexport const size = {\n  width: 1200,\n  height: 630,\n}\nexport const contentType = 'image/png'\n\nexport default async function Image({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }) {\n  const post = await fetch(`https://.../posts/${params.slug}`).then((res) =>\n    res.json()\n  )\n\n  return new ImageResponse(\n    (\n      <div\n        style={{\n          fontSize: 48,\n          background: 'white',\n          width: '100%',\n          height: '100%',\n          display: 'flex',\n          alignItems: 'center',\n          justifyContent: 'center',\n        }}\n      >\n        {post.title}\n      </div>\n    ),\n    {\n      ...size,\n    }\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/posts/[slug]/opengraph-image.js\" switcher\nimport { ImageResponse } from 'next/og'\n\nexport const alt = 'About Acme'\nexport const size = {\n  width: 1200,\n  height: 630,\n}\nexport const contentType = 'image/png'\n\nexport default async function Image({ params }) {\n  const post = await fetch(`https://.../posts/${params.slug}`).then((res) =>\n    res.json()\n  )\n\n  return new ImageResponse(\n    (\n      <div\n        style={{\n          fontSize: 48,\n          background: 'white',\n          width: '100%',\n          height: '100%',\n          display: 'flex',\n          alignItems: 'center',\n          justifyContent: 'center',\n        }}\n      >\n        {post.title}\n      </div>\n    ),\n    {\n      ...size,\n    }\n  )\n}\n```\n\n#### Using Edge runtime with local assets\n\nThis example uses the Edge runtime to fetch a local image on the file system and passes it as an `ArrayBuffer` to the `src` attribute of an `<img>` element. The local asset should be placed relative to the example source file location.\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/opengraph-image.js\" switcher\nimport { ImageResponse } from 'next/og'\nimport { readFile } from 'node:fs/promises'\n\nexport const runtime = 'edge'\n\nexport async function GET() {\n  const logoSrc = await fetch(new URL('./logo.png', import.meta.url)).then(\n    (res) => res.arrayBuffer()\n  )\n\n  return new ImageResponse(\n    (\n      <div\n        style={{\n          display: 'flex',\n          alignItems: 'center',\n          justifyContent: 'center',\n        }}\n      >\n        <img src={logoSrc} height=\"100\" />\n      </div>\n    )\n  )\n}\n```\n\n#### Using Node.js runtime with local assets\n\nThis example uses the Node.js runtime to fetch a local image on the file system and passes it as an `ArrayBuffer` to the `src` attribute of an `<img>` element. The local asset should be placed relative to the root of your project, rather than the location of the example source file.\n\n```jsx filename=\"app/opengraph-image.js\" switcher\nimport { ImageResponse } from 'next/og'\nimport { join } from 'node:path'\nimport { readFile } from 'node:fs/promises'\n\nexport async function GET() {\n  const logoData = await readFile(join(process.cwd(), 'logo.png'))\n  const logoSrc = Uint8Array.from(logoData).buffer\n\n  return new ImageResponse(\n    (\n      <div\n        style={{\n          display: 'flex',\n          alignItems: 'center',\n          justifyContent: 'center',\n        }}\n      >\n        <img src={logoSrc} height=\"100\" />\n      </div>\n    )\n  )\n}\n```\n\n## Version History\n\n| Version   | Changes                                           |\n| --------- | ------------------------------------------------- |\n| `v13.3.0` | `opengraph-image` and `twitter-image` introduced. |\n"},{"path":"docs/02-app/02-api-reference/02-file-conventions/01-metadata/manifest.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/02-app/02-api-reference/02-file-conventions/01-metadata/manifest.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/metadata/manifest","sha":"24942e0918f4b28ed8ad9761a57b4b2fb054b4c2","size":2290,"content":"---\ntitle: manifest.json\ndescription: API Reference for manifest.json file.\n---\n\nAdd or generate a `manifest.(json|webmanifest)` file that matches the [Web Manifest Specification](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Manifest) in the **root** of `app` directory to provide information about your web application for the browser.\n\n## Static Manifest file\n\n```json filename=\"app/manifest.json | app/manifest.webmanifest\"\n{\n  \"name\": \"My Next.js Application\",\n  \"short_name\": \"Next.js App\",\n  \"description\": \"An application built with Next.js\",\n  \"start_url\": \"/\"\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n## Generate a Manifest file\n\nAdd a `manifest.js` or `manifest.ts` file that returns a [`Manifest` object](#manifest-object).\n\n> Good to know: `manifest.js` is special Route Handlers that is cached by default unless it uses a [dynamic function](/docs/app/building-your-application/caching#dynamic-functions) or [dynamic config](/docs/app/building-your-application/caching#segment-config-options) option.\n\n```ts filename=\"app/manifest.ts\" switcher\nimport type { MetadataRoute } from 'next'\n\nexport default function manifest(): MetadataRoute.Manifest {\n  return {\n    name: 'Next.js App',\n    short_name: 'Next.js App',\n    description: 'Next.js App',\n    start_url: '/',\n    display: 'standalone',\n    background_color: '#fff',\n    theme_color: '#fff',\n    icons: [\n      {\n        src: '/favicon.ico',\n        sizes: 'any',\n        type: 'image/x-icon',\n      },\n    ],\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"app/manifest.js\" switcher\nexport default function manifest() {\n  return {\n    name: 'Next.js App',\n    short_name: 'Next.js App',\n    description: 'Next.js App',\n    start_url: '/',\n    display: 'standalone',\n    background_color: '#fff',\n    theme_color: '#fff',\n    icons: [\n      {\n        src: '/favicon.ico',\n        sizes: 'any',\n        type: 'image/x-icon',\n      },\n    ],\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Manifest Object\n\nThe manifest object contains an extensive list of options that may be updated due to new web standards.

If using TypeScript, a [`Sitemap`](#returns) type is available.\n\n> **Good to know**: `sitemap.js` is a special Route Handlers that is cached by default unless it uses a [dynamic function](/docs/app/building-your-application/caching#dynamic-functions) or [dynamic config](/docs/app/building-your-application/caching#segment-config-options) option.\n\n```ts filename=\"app/sitemap.ts\" switcher\nimport type { MetadataRoute } from 'next'\n\nexport default function sitemap(): MetadataRoute.Sitemap {\n  return [\n    {\n      url: 'https://acme.com',\n      lastModified: new Date(),\n      changeFrequency: 'yearly',\n      priority: 1,\n    },\n    {\n      url: 'https://acme.com/about',\n      lastModified: new Date(),\n      changeFrequency: 'monthly',\n      priority: 0.8,\n    },\n    {\n      url: 'https://acme.com/blog',\n      lastModified: new Date(),\n      changeFrequency: 'weekly',\n      priority: 0.5,\n    },\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"app/sitemap.js\" switcher\nexport default function sitemap() {\n  return [\n    {\n      url: 'https://acme.com',\n      lastModified: new Date(),\n      changeFrequency: 'yearly',\n      priority: 1,\n    },\n    {\n      url: 'https://acme.com/about',\n      lastModified: new Date(),\n      changeFrequency: 'monthly',\n      priority: 0.8,\n    },\n    {\n      url: 'https://acme.com/blog',\n      lastModified: new Date(),\n      changeFrequency: 'weekly',\n      priority: 0.5,\n    },\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```xml filename=\"acme.com/sitemap\"\n<urlset xmlns=\"http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9\">\n  <url>\n    <loc>https://acme.com</loc>\n    <lastmod>2023-04-06T15:02:24.021Z</lastmod>\n    <changefreq>yearly</changefreq>\n    <priority>1</priority>\n  </url>\n  <url>\n    <loc>https://acme.com/about</loc>\n    <lastmod>2023-04-06T15:02:24.021Z</lastmod>\n    <changefreq>monthly</changefreq>\n    <priority>0.8</priority>\n  </url>\n  <url>\n    <loc>https://acme.com/blog</loc>\n    <lastmod>2023-04-06T15:02:24.021Z</lastmod>\n    <changefreq>weekly</changefreq>\n    <priority>0.5</priority>\n  </url>\n</urlset>\n```\n\n### Generate a localized Sitemap\n\n```ts filename=\"app/sitemap.ts\" switcher\nimport type { MetadataRoute } from 'next'\n\nexport default function sitemap(): MetadataRoute.Sitemap {\n  return [\n    {\n      url: 'https://acme.com',\n      lastModified: new Date(),\n      alternates: {\n        languages: {\n          es: 'https://acme.com/es',\n          de: 'https://acme.com/de',\n        },\n      },\n    },\n    {\n      url: 'https://acme.com/about',\n      lastModified: new Date(),\n      alternates: {\n        languages: {\n          es: 'https://acme.com/es/about',\n          de: 'https://acme.com/de/about',\n        },\n      },\n    },\n    {\n      url: 'https://acme.com/blog',\n      lastModified: new Date(),\n      alternates: {\n        languages: {\n          es: 'https://acme.com/es/blog',\n          de: 'https://acme.com/de/blog',\n        },\n      },\n    },\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```xml filename=\"acme.com/sitemap\"\n<urlset xmlns=\"http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9\" xmlns:xhtml=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n  <url>\n    <loc>https://acme.com</loc>\n    <xhtml:link\n      rel=\"alternate\"\n      hreflang=\"es\"\n      href=\"https://acme.com/es\"/>\n    <xhtml:link\n      rel=\"alternate\"\n      hreflang=\"de\"\n      href=\"https://acme.com/de\"/>\n    <lastmod>2023-04-06T15:02:24.021Z</lastmod>\n  </url>\n  <url>\n    <loc>https://acme.com/about</loc>\n    <xhtml:link\n      rel=\"alternate\"\n      hreflang=\"es\"\n      href=\"https://acme.com/es/about\"/>\n    <xhtml:link\n      rel=\"alternate\"\n      hreflang=\"de\"\n      href=\"https://acme.com/de/about\"/>\n    <lastmod>2023-04-06T15:02:24.021Z</lastmod>\n  </url>\n  <url>\n    <loc>https://acme.com/blog</loc>\n    <xhtml:link\n      rel=\"alternate\"\n      hreflang=\"es\"\n      href=\"https://acme.com/es/blog\"/>\n    <xhtml:link\n      rel=\"alternate\"\n      hreflang=\"de\"\n      href=\"https://acme.com/de/blog\"/>\n    <lastmod>2023-04-06T15:02:24.021Z</lastmod>\n  </url>\n</urlset>\n```\n\n### Generating multiple sitemaps\n\nWhile a single sitemap will work for most applications. For large web applications, you may need to split a sitemap into multiple files.\n\nThere are two ways you can create multiple sitemaps:\n\n- By nesting `sitemap.(xml|js|ts)` inside multiple route segments e.g. `app/sitemap.xml` and `app/products/sitemap.xml`.\n- By using the [`generateSitemaps`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-sitemaps) function.\n\nFor example, to split a sitemap using `generateSitemaps`, return an array of objects with the sitemap `id`. Then, use the `id` to generate the unique sitemaps.\n\n```ts filename=\"app/product/sitemap.ts\" switcher\nimport type { MetadataRoute } from 'next'\nimport { BASE_URL } from '@/app/lib/constants'\n\nexport async function generateSitemaps() {\n  // Fetch the total number of products and calculate the number of sitemaps needed\n  return [{ id: 0 }, { id: 1 }, { id: 2 }, { id: 3 }]\n}\n\nexport default async function sitemap({\n  id,\n}: {\n  id: number\n}): Promise<MetadataRoute.Sitemap> {\n  // Google's limit is 50,000 URLs per sitemap\n  const start = id * 50000\n  const end = start + 50000\n  const products = await getProducts(\n    `SELECT id, date FROM products WHERE id BETWEEN ${start} AND ${end}`\n  )\n  return products.map((product) => ({\n    url: `${BASE_URL}/product/${id}`,\n    lastModified: product.date,\n  }))\n}\n```\n\n```js filename=\"app/product/sitemap.js\" switcher\nimport { BASE_URL } from '@/app/lib/constants'\n\nexport async function generateSitemaps() {\n  // Fetch the total number of products and calculate the number of sitemaps needed\n  return [{ id: 0 }, { id: 1 }, { id: 2 }, { id: 3 }]\n}\n\nexport default async function sitemap({ id }) {\n  // Google's limit is 50,000 URLs per sitemap\n  const start = id * 50000\n  const end = start + 50000\n  const products = await getProducts(\n    `SELECT id, date FROM products WHERE id BETWEEN ${start} AND ${end}`\n  )\n  return products.map((product) => ({\n    url: `${BASE_URL}/product/${id}`,\n    lastModified: product.date,\n  }))\n}\n```\n\nYour generated sitemaps will be available at `/.../sitemap/[id]`. For example, `/product/sitemap/1`.\n\nSee the [`generateSitemaps` API reference](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-sitemaps) for more information.\n\n## Returns\n\nThe default function exported from `sitemap.(xml|ts|js)` should return an array of objects with the following properties:\n\n```tsx\ntype Sitemap = Array<{\n  url: string\n  lastModified?: string | Date\n  changeFrequency?:\n    | 'always'\n    | 'hourly'\n    | 'daily'\n    | 'weekly'\n    | 'monthly'\n    | 'yearly'\n    | 'never'\n  priority?: number\n  alternates?: {\n    languages?: Languages<string>\n  }\n}>\n```\n\n## Version History\n\n| Version   | Changes                                                      |\n| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| `v14.2.0` | Add localizations support.                                   |\n| `v13.4.5` | Add `changeFrequency` and `priority` attributes to sitemaps. |\n| `v13.3.0` | `sitemap` introduced.                                        |\n"},{"path":"docs/02-app/02-api-reference/05-next-config-js/appDir.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/02-app/02-api-reference/05-next-config-js/appDir.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/appDir","sha":"3e0acdf610d91e1cef4365bdb50a7ddfffbce8e4","size":889,"content":"---\ntitle: appDir\ndescription: Enable the App Router to use layouts, streaming, and more.\n---\n\n> **Good to know**: This option is **no longer** needed as of Next.js 13.4.

There are currently some limitations:\n\n- Only a core subset of the webpack loader API is implemented. Currently, there is enough coverage for some popular loaders, and we'll expand our API support in the future.\n- Only loaders that return JavaScript code are supported. Loaders that transform files like stylesheets or images are not currently supported.\n- Options passed to webpack loaders must be plain JavaScript primitives, objects, and arrays. For example, it's not possible to pass `require()`d plugin modules as option values.\n\nTo configure loaders, add the names of the loaders you've installed and any options in `next.config.js`, mapping file extensions to a list of loaders:\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  experimental: {\n    turbo: {\n      rules: {\n        '*.svg': {\n          loaders: ['@svgr/webpack'],\n          as: '*.js',\n        },\n      },\n    },\n  },\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know**: Prior to Next.js version 13.4.4, `experimental.turbo.rules` was named `experimental.turbo.loaders` and only accepted file extensions like `.mdx` instead of `*.mdx`.\n\n### Supported loaders\n\nThe following loaders have been tested to work with Turbopack's webpack loader implementation:\n\n- [`babel-loader`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-loader)\n- [`@svgr/webpack`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@svgr/webpack)\n- [`svg-inline-loader`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/svg-inline-loader)\n- [`yaml-loader`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yaml-loader)\n- [`string-replace-loader`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/string-replace-loader)\n- [`raw-loader`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/raw-loader)\n- [`sass-loader`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass-loader)\n\n## Resolve aliases\n\nThrough `next.config.js`, Turbopack can be configured to modify module resolution through aliases, similar to webpack's [`resolve.alias`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/resolve/#resolvealias) configuration.\n\nTo configure resolve aliases, map imported patterns to their new destination in `next.config.js`:\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  experimental: {\n    turbo: {\n      resolveAlias: {\n        underscore: 'lodash',\n        mocha: { browser: 'mocha/browser-entry.js' },\n      },\n    },\n  },\n}\n```\n\nThis aliases imports of the `underscore` package to the `lodash` package. In other words, `import underscore from 'underscore'` will load the `lodash` module instead of `underscore`.\n\nTurbopack also supports conditional aliasing through this field, similar to Node.js's [conditional exports](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v18.x/api/packages.html#conditional-exports). At the moment only the `browser` condition is supported. In the case above, imports of the `mocha` module will be aliased to `mocha/browser-entry.js` when Turbopack targets browser environments.\n\n## Resolve extensions\n\nThrough `next.config.js`, Turbopack can be configured to resolve modules with custom extensions, similar to webpack's [`resolve.extensions`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/resolve/#resolveextensions) configuration.\n\nTo configure resolve extensions, use the `resolveExtensions` field in `next.config.js`:\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  experimental: {\n    turbo: {\n      resolveExtensions: [\n        '.mdx',\n        '.tsx',\n        '.ts',\n        '.jsx',\n        '.js',\n        '.mjs',\n        '.json',\n      ],\n    },\n  },\n}\n```\n\nThis overwrites the original resolve extensions with the provided list. Make sure to include the default extensions.\n\nFor more information and guidance for how to migrate your app to Turbopack from webpack, see [Turbopack's documentation on webpack compatibility](https://turbo.build/pack/docs/migrating-from-webpack).\n"},{"path":"docs/02-app/02-api-reference/05-next-config-js/redirects.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/02-app/02-api-reference/05-next-config-js/redirects.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/redirects","sha":"d8c4fc6c5880e277cc65540a6d468de3b9663798","size":11442,"content":"---\ntitle: redirects\ndescription: Add redirects to your Next.js app.\n---\n\n{/* The content of this doc is shared between the app and pages router. You can use the `<PagesOnly>Content</PagesOnly>` component to add content that is specific to the Pages Router. Any shared content should not be wrapped in a component. */}\n\nRedirects allow you to redirect an incoming request path to a different destination path.\n\nTo use redirects you can use the `redirects` key in `next.config.js`:\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  async redirects() {\n    return [\n      {\n        source: '/about',\n        destination: '/',\n        permanent: true,\n      },\n    ]\n  },\n}\n```\n\n`redirects` is an async function that expects an array to be returned holding objects with `source`, `destination`, and `permanent` properties:\n\n- `source` is the incoming request path pattern.\n- `destination` is the path you want to route to.\n- `permanent` `true` or `false` - if `true` will use the 308 status code which instructs clients/search engines to cache the redirect forever, if `false` will use the 307 status code which is temporary and is not cached.\n\n> **Why does Next.js use 307 and 308?** Traditionally a 302 was used for a temporary redirect, and a 301 for a permanent redirect, but many browsers changed the request method of the redirect to `GET`, regardless of the original method. For example, if the browser made a request to `POST /v1/users` which returned status code `302` with location `/v2/users`, the subsequent request might be `GET /v2/users` instead of the expected `POST /v2/users`. Next.js uses the 307 temporary redirect, and 308 permanent redirect status codes to explicitly preserve the request method used.\n\n- `basePath`: `false` or `undefined` - if false the `basePath` won't be included when matching, can be used for external redirects only.\n- `locale`: `false` or `undefined` - whether the locale should not be included when matching.\n- `has` is an array of [has objects](#header-cookie-and-query-matching) with the `type`, `key` and `value` properties.\n- `missing` is an array of [missing objects](#header-cookie-and-query-matching) with the `type`, `key` and `value` properties.\n\nRedirects are checked before the filesystem which includes pages and `/public` files.\n\nWhen using the Pages Router, redirects are not applied to client-side routing (`Link`, `router.push`) unless [Middleware](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware) is present and matches the path.\n\nWhen a redirect is applied, any query values provided in the request will be passed through to the redirect destination. For example, see the following redirect configuration:\n\n```js\n{\n  source: '/old-blog/:path*',\n  destination: '/blog/:path*',\n  permanent: false\n}\n```\n\nWhen `/old-blog/post-1?hello=world` is requested, the client will be redirected to `/blog/post-1?hello=world`.\n\n## Path Matching\n\nPath matches are allowed, for example `/old-blog/:slug` will match `/old-blog/hello-world` (no nested paths):\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  async redirects() {\n    return [\n      {\n        source: '/old-blog/:slug',\n        destination: '/news/:slug', // Matched parameters can be used in the destination\n        permanent: true,\n      },\n    ]\n  },\n}\n```\n\n### Wildcard Path Matching\n\nTo match a wildcard path you can use `*` after a parameter, for example `/blog/:slug*` will match `/blog/a/b/c/d/hello-world`:\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  async redirects() {\n    return [\n      {\n        source: '/blog/:slug*',\n        destination: '/news/:slug*', // Matched parameters can be used in the destination\n        permanent: true,\n      },\n    ]\n  },\n}\n```\n\n### Regex Path Matching\n\nTo match a regex path you can wrap the regex in parentheses after a parameter, for example `/post/:slug(\\\\d{1,})` will match `/post/123` but not `/post/abc`:\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  async redirects() {\n    return [\n      {\n        source: '/post/:slug(\\\\d{1,})',\n        destination: '/news/:slug', // Matched parameters can be used in the destination\n        permanent: false,\n      },\n    ]\n  },\n}\n```\n\nThe following characters `(`, `)`, `{`, `}`, `:`, `*`, `+`, `?` are used for regex path matching, so when used in the `source` as non-special values they must be escaped by adding `\\\\` before them:\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  async redirects() {\n    return [\n      {\n        // this will match `/english(default)/something` being requested\n        source: '/english\\\\(default\\\\)/:slug',\n        destination: '/en-us/:slug',\n        permanent: false,\n      },\n    ]\n  },\n}\n```\n\n## Header, Cookie, and Query Matching\n\nTo only match a redirect when header, cookie, or query values also match the `has` field or don't match the `missing` field can be used. Both the `source` and all `has` items must match and all `missing` items must not match for the redirect to be applied.\n\n`has` and `missing` items can have the following fields:\n\n- `type`: `String` - must be either `header`, `cookie`, `host`, or `query`.\n- `key`: `String` - the key from the selected type to match against.\n- `value`: `String` or `undefined` - the value to check for, if undefined any value will match. A regex like string can be used to capture a specific part of the value, e.g. if the value `first-(?<paramName>.*)` is used for `first-second` then `second` will be usable in the destination with `:paramName`.\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  async redirects() {\n    return [\n      // if the header `x-redirect-me` is present,\n      // this redirect will be applied\n      {\n        source: '/:path((?!another-page$).*)',\n        has: [\n          {\n            type: 'header',\n            key: 'x-redirect-me',\n          },\n        ],\n        permanent: false,\n        destination: '/another-page',\n      },\n      // if the header `x-dont-redirect` is present,\n      // this redirect will NOT be applied\n      {\n        source: '/:path((?!another-page$).*)',\n        missing: [\n          {\n            type: 'header',\n            key: 'x-do-not-redirect',\n          },\n        ],\n        permanent: false,\n        destination: '/another-page',\n      },\n      // if the source, query, and cookie are matched,\n      // this redirect will be applied\n      {\n        source: '/specific/:path*',\n        has: [\n          {\n            type: 'query',\n            key: 'page',\n            // the page value will not be available in the\n            // destination since value is provided and doesn't\n            // use a named capture group e.g. (?<page>home)\n            value: 'home',\n          },\n          {\n            type: 'cookie',\n            key: 'authorized',\n            value: 'true',\n          },\n        ],\n        permanent: false,\n        destination: '/another/:path*',\n      },\n      // if the header `x-authorized` is present and\n      // contains a matching value, this redirect will be applied\n      {\n        source: '/',\n        has: [\n          {\n            type: 'header',\n            key: 'x-authorized',\n            value: '(?<authorized>yes|true)',\n          },\n        ],\n        permanent: false,\n        destination: '/home?authorized=:authorized',\n      },\n      // if the host is `example.com`,\n      // this redirect will be applied\n      {\n        source: '/:path((?!another-page$).*)',\n        has: [\n          {\n            type: 'host',\n            value: 'example.com',\n          },\n        ],\n        permanent: false,\n        destination: '/another-page',\n      },\n    ]\n  },\n}\n```\n\n### Redirects with basePath support\n\nWhen leveraging [`basePath` support](/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/basePath) with redirects each `source` and `destination` is automatically prefixed with the `basePath` unless you add `basePath: false` to the redirect:\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  basePath: '/docs',\n\n  async redirects() {\n    return [\n      {\n        source: '/with-basePath', // automatically becomes /docs/with-basePath\n        destination: '/another', // automatically becomes /docs/another\n        permanent: false,\n      },\n      {\n        // does not add /docs since basePath: false is set\n        source: '/without-basePath',\n        destination: 'https://example.com',\n        basePath: false,\n        permanent: false,\n      },\n    ]\n  },\n}\n```\n\n### Redirects with i18n support\n\n<AppOnly>\n\nWhen leveraging [`i18n` support](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/internationalization) with redirects each `source` and `destination` is automatically prefixed to handle the configured `locales` unless you add `locale: false` to the redirect. If `locale: false` is used you must prefix the `source` and `destination` with a locale for it to be matched correctly.\n\n</AppOnly>\n\n<PagesOnly>\n\nWhen leveraging [`i18n` support](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/internationalization) with redirects each `source` and `destination` is automatically prefixed to handle the configured `locales` unless you add `locale: false` to the redirect. If `locale: false` is used you must prefix the `source` and `destination` with a locale for it to be matched correctly.\n\n</PagesOnly>\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  i18n: {\n    locales: ['en', 'fr', 'de'],\n    defaultLocale: 'en',\n  },\n\n  async redirects() {\n    return [\n      {\n        source: '/with-locale', // automatically handles all locales\n        destination: '/another', // automatically passes the locale on\n        permanent: false,\n      },\n      {\n        // does not handle locales automatically since locale: false is set\n        source: '/nl/with-locale-manual',\n        destination: '/nl/another',\n        locale: false,\n        permanent: false,\n      },\n      {\n        // this matches '/' since `en` is the defaultLocale\n        source: '/en',\n        destination: '/en/another',\n        locale: false,\n        permanent: false,\n      },\n      // it's possible to match all locales even when locale: false is set\n      {\n        source: '/:locale/page',\n        destination: '/en/newpage',\n        permanent: false,\n        locale: false,\n      },\n      {\n        // this gets converted to /(en|fr|de)/(.*) so will not match the top-level\n        // `/` or `/fr` routes like /:path* would\n        source: '/(.*)',\n        destination: '/another',\n        permanent: false,\n      },\n    ]\n  },\n}\n```\n\nIn some rare cases, you might need to assign a custom status code for older HTTP Clients to properly redirect. In these cases, you can use the `statusCode` property instead of the `permanent` property, but not both. To to ensure IE11 compatibility, a `Refresh` header is automatically added for the 308 status code.\n\n## Other Redirects\n\n- Inside [API Routes](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) and [Route Handlers](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-handlers), you can redirect based on the incoming request.\n- Inside [`getStaticProps`](/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-static-props) and [`getServerSideProps`](/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-server-side-props), you can redirect specific pages at request-time.\n\n## Version History\n\n| Version   | Changes            |\n| --------- | ------------------ |\n| `v13.3.0` | `missing` added.   |\n| `v10.2.0` | `has` added.       |\n| `v9.5.0`  | `redirects` added. |\n"},{"path":"docs/02-app/02-api-reference/05-next-config-js/crossOrigin.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/02-app/02-api-reference/05-next-config-js/crossOrigin.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/crossOrigin","sha":"47121b85b8363c239a6592abd8addf4349aa5cba","size":1291,"content":"---\ntitle: crossOrigin\ndescription: Use the `crossOrigin` option to add a crossOrigin tag on the `script` tags generated by `next/script`.\n---\n\n{/* The content of this doc is shared between the app and pages router.

For example, with the above configuration, the following request for a JS chunk:\n\n```\n/_next/static/chunks/4b9b41aaa062cbbfeff4add70f256968c51ece5d.4d708494b3aed70c04f0.js\n```\n\nWould instead become:\n\n```\nhttps://cdn.mydomain.com/_next/static/chunks/4b9b41aaa062cbbfeff4add70f256968c51ece5d.4d708494b3aed70c04f0.js\n```\n\nThe exact configuration for uploading your files to a given CDN will depend on your CDN of choice.

You can incrementally migrate on a page-by-page basis using `<React.StrictMode>`.\n"},{"path":"docs/02-app/02-api-reference/05-next-config-js/transpilePackages.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/02-app/02-api-reference/05-next-config-js/transpilePackages.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/transpilePackages","sha":"a6aecbb18bbe5fa2d78ec7e4339b013b5adb4ef1","size":942,"content":"---\ntitle: transpilePackages\ndescription: Automatically transpile and bundle dependencies from local packages (like monorepos) or from external dependencies (`node_modules`).\n---\n\n{/* The content of this doc is shared between the app and pages router.

You can use the `<PagesOnly>Content</PagesOnly>` component to add content that is specific to the Pages Router. Any shared content should not be wrapped in a component. */}\n\nDuring a build, Next.js will automatically trace each page and its dependencies to determine all of the files that are needed for deploying a production version of your application.\n\nThis feature helps reduce the size of deployments drastically. Previously, when deploying with Docker you would need to have all files from your package's `dependencies` installed to run `next start`. Starting with Next.js 12, you can leverage Output File Tracing in the `.next/` directory to only include the necessary files.\n\nFurthermore, this removes the need for the deprecated `serverless` target which can cause various issues and also creates unnecessary duplication.\n\n## How it Works\n\nDuring `next build`, Next.js will use [`@vercel/nft`](https://github.com/vercel/nft) to statically analyze `import`, `require`, and `fs` usage to determine all files that a page might load.\n\nNext.js' production server is also traced for its needed files and output at `.next/next-server.js.nft.json` which can be leveraged in production.\n\nTo leverage the `.nft.json` files emitted to the `.next` output directory, you can read the list of files in each trace that are relative to the `.nft.json` file and then copy them to your deployment location.\n\n## Automatically Copying Traced Files\n\nNext.js can automatically create a `standalone` folder that copies only the necessary files for a production deployment including select files in `node_modules`.\n\nTo leverage this automatic copying you can enable it in your `next.config.js`:\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  output: 'standalone',\n}\n```\n\nThis will create a folder at `.next/standalone` which can then be deployed on its own without installing `node_modules`.\n\nAdditionally, a minimal `server.js` file is also output which can be used instead of `next start`. This minimal server does not copy the `public` or `.next/static` folders by default as these should ideally be handled by a CDN instead, although these folders can be copied to the `standalone/public` and `standalone/.next/static` folders manually, after which `server.js` file will serve these automatically.\n\n<AppOnly>\n\n> **Good to know**:\n>\n> - If your project needs to listen to a specific port or hostname, you can define `PORT` or `HOSTNAME` environment variables before running `server.js`. For example, run `PORT=8080 HOSTNAME=0.0.0.0 node server.js` to start the server on `http://0.0.0.0:8080`.\n\n</AppOnly>\n\n<PagesOnly>\n\n> **Good to know**:\n>\n> - `next.config.js` is read during `next build` and serialized into the `server.js` output file. If the legacy [`serverRuntimeConfig` or `publicRuntimeConfig` options](/docs/pages/api-reference/next-config-js/runtime-configuration) are being used, the values will be specific to values at build time.\n> - If your project needs to listen to a specific port or hostname, you can define `PORT` or `HOSTNAME` environment variables before running `server.js`. For example, run `PORT=8080 HOSTNAME=0.0.0.0 node server.js` to start the server on `http://0.0.0.0:8080`.\n\n</PagesOnly>\n\n## Caveats\n\n- While tracing in monorepo setups, the project directory is used for tracing by default. For `next build packages/web-app`, `packages/web-app` would be the tracing root and any files outside of that folder will not be included. To include files outside of this folder you can set `experimental.outputFileTracingRoot` in your `next.config.js`.\n\n```js filename=\"packages/web-app/next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  experimental: {\n    // this includes files from the monorepo base two directories up\n    outputFileTracingRoot: path.join(__dirname, '../../'),\n  },\n}\n```\n\n- There are some cases in which Next.js might fail to include required files, or might incorrectly include unused files. In those cases, you can leverage `experimental.outputFileTracingExcludes` and `experimental.outputFileTracingIncludes` respectively in `next.config.js`. Each config accepts an object with [minimatch globs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/minimatch) for the key to match specific pages and a value of an array with globs relative to the project's root to either include or exclude in the trace.\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  experimental: {\n    outputFileTracingExcludes: {\n      '/api/hello': ['./un-necessary-folder/**/*'],\n    },\n    outputFileTracingIncludes: {\n      '/api/another': ['./necessary-folder/**/*'],\n    },\n  },\n}\n```\n\n- Currently, Next.js does not do anything with the emitted `.nft.json` files. The files must be read by your deployment platform, for example [Vercel](https://vercel.com), to create a minimal deployment. In a future release, a new command is planned to utilize these `.nft.json` files.\n\n## Experimental `turbotrace`\n\nTracing dependencies can be slow because it requires very complex computations and analysis. We created `turbotrace` in Rust as a faster and smarter alternative to the JavaScript implementation.\n\nTo enable it, you can add the following configuration to your `next.config.js`:\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  experimental: {\n    turbotrace: {\n      // control the log level of the turbotrace, default is `error`\n      logLevel?:\n      | 'bug'\n      | 'fatal'\n      | 'error'\n      | 'warning'\n      | 'hint'\n      | 'note'\n      | 'suggestions'\n      | 'info',\n      // control if the log of turbotrace should contain the details of the analysis, default is `false`\n      logDetail?: boolean\n      // show all log messages without limit\n      // turbotrace only show 1 log message for each categories by default\n      logAll?: boolean\n      // control the context directory of the turbotrace\n      // files outside of the context directory will not be traced\n      // set the `experimental.outputFileTracingRoot` has the same effect\n      // if the `experimental.outputFileTracingRoot` and this option are both set, the `experimental.turbotrace.contextDirectory` will be used\n      contextDirectory?: string\n      // if there is `process.cwd()` expression in your code, you can set this option to tell `turbotrace` the value of `process.cwd()` while tracing.\n      // for example the require(process.cwd() + '/package.json') will be traced as require('/path/to/cwd/package.json')\n      processCwd?: string\n      // control the maximum memory usage of the `turbotrace`, in `MB`, default is `6000`.\n      memoryLimit?: number\n    },\n  },\n}\n```\n"},{"path":"docs/02-app/02-api-reference/05-next-config-js/headers.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/02-app/02-api-reference/05-next-config-js/headers.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/headers","sha":"d8ed4ee398311ee1dd8cf6c29abe248e7f3fe46b","size":16367,"content":"---\ntitle: headers\ndescription: Add custom HTTP headers to your Next.js app.\n---\n\n{/* The content of this doc is shared between the app and pages router. You can use the `<PagesOnly>Content</PagesOnly>` component to add content that is specific to the Pages Router. Any shared content should not be wrapped in a component. */}\n\nHeaders allow you to set custom HTTP headers on the response to an incoming request on a given path.\n\nTo set custom HTTP headers you can use the `headers` key in `next.config.js`:\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  async headers() {\n    return [\n      {\n        source: '/about',\n        headers: [\n          {\n            key: 'x-custom-header',\n            value: 'my custom header value',\n          },\n          {\n            key: 'x-another-custom-header',\n            value: 'my other custom header value',\n          },\n        ],\n      },\n    ]\n  },\n}\n```\n\n`headers` is an async function that expects an array to be returned holding objects with `source` and `headers` properties:\n\n- `source` is the incoming request path pattern.\n- `headers` is an array of response header objects, with `key` and `value` properties.\n- `basePath`: `false` or `undefined` - if false the basePath won't be included when matching, can be used for external rewrites only.\n- `locale`: `false` or `undefined` - whether the locale should not be included when matching.\n- `has` is an array of [has objects](#header-cookie-and-query-matching) with the `type`, `key` and `value` properties.\n- `missing` is an array of [missing objects](#header-cookie-and-query-matching) with the `type`, `key` and `value` properties.\n\nHeaders are checked before the filesystem which includes pages and `/public` files.\n\n## Header Overriding Behavior\n\nIf two headers match the same path and set the same header key, the last header key will override the first. Using the below headers, the path `/hello` will result in the header `x-hello` being `world` due to the last header value set being `world`.\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  async headers() {\n    return [\n      {\n        source: '/:path*',\n        headers: [\n          {\n            key: 'x-hello',\n            value: 'there',\n          },\n        ],\n      },\n      {\n        source: '/hello',\n        headers: [\n          {\n            key: 'x-hello',\n            value: 'world',\n          },\n        ],\n      },\n    ]\n  },\n}\n```\n\n## Path Matching\n\nPath matches are allowed, for example `/blog/:slug` will match `/blog/hello-world` (no nested paths):\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  async headers() {\n    return [\n      {\n        source: '/blog/:slug',\n        headers: [\n          {\n            key: 'x-slug',\n            value: ':slug', // Matched parameters can be used in the value\n          },\n          {\n            key: 'x-slug-:slug', // Matched parameters can be used in the key\n            value: 'my other custom header value',\n          },\n        ],\n      },\n    ]\n  },\n}\n```\n\n### Wildcard Path Matching\n\nTo match a wildcard path you can use `*` after a parameter, for example `/blog/:slug*` will match `/blog/a/b/c/d/hello-world`:\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  async headers() {\n    return [\n      {\n        source: '/blog/:slug*',\n        headers: [\n          {\n            key: 'x-slug',\n            value: ':slug*', // Matched parameters can be used in the value\n          },\n          {\n            key: 'x-slug-:slug*', // Matched parameters can be used in the key\n            value: 'my other custom header value',\n          },\n        ],\n      },\n    ]\n  },\n}\n```\n\n### Regex Path Matching\n\nTo match a regex path you can wrap the regex in parenthesis after a parameter, for example `/blog/:slug(\\\\d{1,})` will match `/blog/123` but not `/blog/abc`:\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  async headers() {\n    return [\n      {\n        source: '/blog/:post(\\\\d{1,})',\n        headers: [\n          {\n            key: 'x-post',\n            value: ':post',\n          },\n        ],\n      },\n    ]\n  },\n}\n```\n\nThe following characters `(`, `)`, `{`, `}`, `:`, `*`, `+`, `?` are used for regex path matching, so when used in the `source` as non-special values they must be escaped by adding `\\\\` before them:\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  async headers() {\n    return [\n      {\n        // this will match `/english(default)/something` being requested\n        source: '/english\\\\(default\\\\)/:slug',\n        headers: [\n          {\n            key: 'x-header',\n            value: 'value',\n          },\n        ],\n      },\n    ]\n  },\n}\n```\n\n## Header, Cookie, and Query Matching\n\nTo only apply a header when header, cookie, or query values also match the `has` field or don't match the `missing` field can be used. Both the `source` and all `has` items must match and all `missing` items must not match for the header to be applied.\n\n`has` and `missing` items can have the following fields:\n\n- `type`: `String` - must be either `header`, `cookie`, `host`, or `query`.\n- `key`: `String` - the key from the selected type to match against.\n- `value`: `String` or `undefined` - the value to check for, if undefined any value will match.

You can set the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header to allow a specific origin to access your <PagesOnly>API Endpoints</PagesOnly><AppOnly>Route Handlers</AppOnly>.\n\n```js\nasync headers() {\n    return [\n      {\n        source: \"/api/:path*\",\n        headers: [\n          {\n            key: \"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\",\n            value: \"*\", // Set your origin\n          },\n          {\n            key: \"Access-Control-Allow-Methods\",\n            value: \"GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS\",\n          },\n          {\n            key: \"Access-Control-Allow-Headers\",\n            value: \"Content-Type, Authorization\",\n          },\n        ],\n      },\n    ];\n  },\n```\n\n### X-DNS-Prefetch-Control\n\n[This header](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-DNS-Prefetch-Control) controls DNS prefetching, allowing browsers to proactively perform domain name resolution on external links, images, CSS, JavaScript, and more. This prefetching is performed in the background, so the [DNS](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Glossary/DNS) is more likely to be resolved by the time the referenced items are needed. This reduces latency when the user clicks a link.\n\n```js\n{\n  key: 'X-DNS-Prefetch-Control',\n  value: 'on'\n}\n```\n\n### Strict-Transport-Security\n\n[This header](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security) informs browsers it should only be accessed using HTTPS, instead of using HTTP. Using the configuration below, all present and future subdomains will use HTTPS for a `max-age` of 2 years. This blocks access to pages or subdomains that can only be served over HTTP.\n\nIf you're deploying to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/edge-network/headers#strict-transport-security?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=next-website), this header is not necessary as it's automatically added to all deployments unless you declare `headers` in your `next.config.js`.\n\n```js\n{\n  key: 'Strict-Transport-Security',\n  value: 'max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload'\n}\n```\n\n### X-Frame-Options\n\n[This header](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Frame-Options) indicates whether the site should be allowed to be displayed within an `iframe`. This can prevent against clickjacking attacks.\n\n**This header has been superseded by CSP's `frame-ancestors` option**, which has better support in modern browsers (see [Content Security Policy](/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/content-security-policy) for configuration details).\n\n```js\n{\n  key: 'X-Frame-Options',\n  value: 'SAMEORIGIN'\n}\n```\n\n### Permissions-Policy\n\n[This header](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Permissions-Policy) allows you to control which features and APIs can be used in the browser. It was previously named `Feature-Policy`.\n\n```js\n{\n  key: 'Permissions-Policy',\n  value: 'camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=(), browsing-topics=()'\n}\n```\n\n### X-Content-Type-Options\n\n[This header](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Content-Type-Options) prevents the browser from attempting to guess the type of content if the `Content-Type` header is not explicitly set. This can prevent XSS exploits for websites that allow users to upload and share files.\n\nFor example, a user trying to download an image, but having it treated as a different `Content-Type` like an executable, which could be malicious. This header also applies to downloading browser extensions. The only valid value for this header is `nosniff`.\n\n```js\n{\n  key: 'X-Content-Type-Options',\n  value: 'nosniff'\n}\n```\n\n### Referrer-Policy\n\n[This header](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Referrer-Policy) controls how much information the browser includes when navigating from the current website (origin) to another.\n\n```js\n{\n  key: 'Referrer-Policy',\n  value: 'origin-when-cross-origin'\n}\n```\n\n### Content-Security-Policy\n\nLearn more about adding a [Content Security Policy](/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/content-security-policy) to your application.\n\n## Version History\n\n| Version   | Changes          |\n| --------- | ---------------- |\n| `v13.3.0` | `missing` added. |\n| `v10.2.0` | `has` added.     |\n| `v9.5.0`  | Headers added.   |\n"},{"path":"docs/02-app/02-api-reference/05-next-config-js/instrumentationHook.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/02-app/02-api-reference/05-next-config-js/instrumentationHook.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/instrumentationHook","sha":"ff183d402b7396760a0564a34e579ec0932667ba","size":864,"content":"---\ntitle: instrumentationHook\ndescription: Use the instrumentationHook option to set up instrumentation in your Next.js App.\nrelated:\n  title: Learn more about Instrumentation\n  links:\n    - app/api-reference/file-conventions/instrumentation\n    - app/building-your-application/optimizing/instrumentation\n---\n\n{/* The content of this doc is shared between the app and pages router.

Only use domains that you trust to download and execute on your machine. Please exercise\n> discretion, and caution until the feature is flagged as stable.\n\nTo opt-in, add the allowed URL prefixes inside `next.config.js`:\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  experimental: {\n    urlImports: ['https://example.com/assets/', 'https://cdn.skypack.dev'],\n  },\n}\n```\n\nThen, you can import modules directly from URLs:\n\n```js\nimport { a, b, c } from 'https://example.com/assets/some/module.js'\n```\n\nURL Imports can be used everywhere normal package imports can be used.\n\n## Security Model\n\nThis feature is being designed with **security as the top priority**. To start, we added an experimental flag forcing you to explicitly allow the domains you accept URL imports from. We're working to take this further by limiting URL imports to execute in the browser sandbox using the [Edge Runtime](/docs/app/api-reference/edge).\n\n## Lockfile\n\nWhen using URL imports, Next.js will create a `next.lock` directory containing a lockfile and fetched assets.\nThis directory **must be committed to Git**, not ignored by `.gitignore`.\n\n- When running `next dev`, Next.js will download and add all newly discovered URL Imports to your lockfile\n- When running `next build`, Next.js will use only the lockfile to build the application for production\n\nTypically, no network requests are needed and any outdated lockfile will cause the build to fail.\nOne exception is resources that respond with `Cache-Control: no-cache`.\nThese resources will have a `no-cache` entry in the lockfile and will always be fetched from the network on each build.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Skypack\n\n```js\nimport confetti from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/canvas-confetti'\nimport { useEffect } from 'react'\n\nexport default () => {\n  useEffect(() => {\n    confetti()\n  })\n  return <p>Hello</p>\n}\n```\n\n### Static Image Imports\n\n```js\nimport Image from 'next/image'\nimport logo from 'https://example.com/assets/logo.png'\n\nexport default () => (\n  <div>\n    <Image src={logo} placeholder=\"blur\" />\n  </div>\n)\n```\n\n### URLs in CSS\n\n```css\n.className {\n  background: url('https://example.com/assets/hero.jpg');\n}\n```\n\n### Asset Imports\n\n```js\nconst logo = new URL('https://example.com/assets/file.txt', import.meta.url)\n\nconsole.log(logo.pathname)\n\n// prints \"/_next/static/media/file.a9727b5d.txt\"\n```\n"},{"path":"docs/02-app/02-api-reference/05-next-config-js/exportPathMap.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/02-app/02-api-reference/05-next-config-js/exportPathMap.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/exportPathMap","sha":"be454aaf42141fe944a66d15de9150890829dd30","size":4542,"content":"---\ntitle: exportPathMap (Deprecated)\nnav_title: exportPathMap\ndescription: Customize the pages that will be exported as HTML files when using `next export`.\n---\n\n{/* The content of this doc is shared between the app and pages router.

Paths defined in `exportPathMap` will also be available when using [`next dev`](/docs/app/api-reference/next-cli#development).\n\nLet's start with an example, to create a custom `exportPathMap` for an app with the following pages:\n\n- `pages/index.js`\n- `pages/about.js`\n- `pages/post.js`\n\nOpen `next.config.js` and add the following `exportPathMap` config:\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  exportPathMap: async function (\n    defaultPathMap,\n    { dev, dir, outDir, distDir, buildId }\n  ) {\n    return {\n      '/': { page: '/' },\n      '/about': { page: '/about' },\n      '/p/hello-nextjs': { page: '/post', query: { title: 'hello-nextjs' } },\n      '/p/learn-nextjs': { page: '/post', query: { title: 'learn-nextjs' } },\n      '/p/deploy-nextjs': { page: '/post', query: { title: 'deploy-nextjs' } },\n    }\n  },\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know**: the `query` field in `exportPathMap` cannot be used with [automatically statically optimized pages](/docs/pages/building-your-application/rendering/automatic-static-optimization) or [`getStaticProps` pages](/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-static-props) as they are rendered to HTML files at build-time and additional query information cannot be provided during `next export`.\n\nThe pages will then be exported as HTML files, for example, `/about` will become `/about.html`.\n\n`exportPathMap` is an `async` function that receives 2 arguments: the first one is `defaultPathMap`, which is the default map used by Next.js. The second argument is an object with:\n\n- `dev` - `true` when `exportPathMap` is being called in development. `false` when running `next export`. In development `exportPathMap` is used to define routes.\n- `dir` - Absolute path to the project directory\n- `outDir` - Absolute path to the `out/` directory ([configurable with `-o`](#customizing-the-output-directory)). When `dev` is `true` the value of `outDir` will be `null`.\n- `distDir` - Absolute path to the `.next/` directory (configurable with the [`distDir`](/docs/pages/api-reference/next-config-js/distDir) config)\n- `buildId` - The generated build id\n\nThe returned object is a map of pages where the `key` is the `pathname` and the `value` is an object that accepts the following fields:\n\n- `page`: `String` - the page inside the `pages` directory to render\n- `query`: `Object` - the `query` object passed to `getInitialProps` when prerendering. Defaults to `{}`\n\n> The exported `pathname` can also be a filename (for example, `/readme.md`), but you may need to set the `Content-Type` header to `text/html` when serving its content if it is different than `.html`.\n\n## Adding a trailing slash\n\nIt is possible to configure Next.js to export pages as `index.html` files and require trailing slashes, `/about` becomes `/about/index.html` and is routable via `/about/`. This was the default behavior prior to Next.js 9.\n\nTo switch back and add a trailing slash, open `next.config.js` and enable the `trailingSlash` config:\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  trailingSlash: true,\n}\n```\n\n## Customizing the output directory\n\n<AppOnly>\n\n[`next export`](/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports) will use `out` as the default output directory, you can customize this using the `-o` argument, like so:\n\n</AppOnly>\n\n<PagesOnly>\n\n[`next export`](/docs/pages/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports) will use `out` as the default output directory, you can customize this using the `-o` argument, like so:\n\n</PagesOnly>\n\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nnext export -o outdir\n```\n\n> **Warning**: Using `exportPathMap` is deprecated and is overridden by `getStaticPaths` inside `pages`. We don't recommend using them together.\n"},{"path":"docs/02-app/02-api-reference/05-next-config-js/rewrites.mdx","docUrl":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/02-app/02-api-reference/05-next-config-js/rewrites.mdx","prodUrl":"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/rewrites","sha":"1b47d79850c4bfc38b8b17fcd682106b7243dc53","size":16416,"content":"---\ntitle: rewrites\ndescription: Add rewrites to your Next.js app.\n---\n\n{/* The content of this doc is shared between the app and pages router.

In contrast, [redirects](/docs/pages/api-reference/next-config-js/redirects) will reroute to a new page and show the URL changes.\n\n</PagesOnly>\n\nTo use rewrites you can use the `rewrites` key in `next.config.js`:\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  async rewrites() {\n    return [\n      {\n        source: '/about',\n        destination: '/',\n      },\n    ]\n  },\n}\n```\n\nRewrites are applied to client-side routing, a `<Link href=\"/about\">` will have the rewrite applied in the above example.\n\n`rewrites` is an async function that expects to return either an array or an object of arrays (see below) holding objects with `source` and `destination` properties:\n\n- `source`: `String` - is the incoming request path pattern.\n- `destination`: `String` is the path you want to route to.\n- `basePath`: `false` or `undefined` - if false the basePath won't be included when matching, can be used for external rewrites only.\n- `locale`: `false` or `undefined` - whether the locale should not be included when matching.\n- `has` is an array of [has objects](#header-cookie-and-query-matching) with the `type`, `key` and `value` properties.\n- `missing` is an array of [missing objects](#header-cookie-and-query-matching) with the `type`, `key` and `value` properties.\n\nWhen the `rewrites` function returns an array, rewrites are applied after checking the filesystem (pages and `/public` files) and before dynamic routes. When the `rewrites` function returns an object of arrays with a specific shape, this behavior can be changed and more finely controlled, as of `v10.1` of Next.js:\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  async rewrites() {\n    return {\n      beforeFiles: [\n        // These rewrites are checked after headers/redirects\n        // and before all files including _next/public files which\n        // allows overriding page files\n        {\n          source: '/some-page',\n          destination: '/somewhere-else',\n          has: [{ type: 'query', key: 'overrideMe' }],\n        },\n      ],\n      afterFiles: [\n        // These rewrites are checked after pages/public files\n        // are checked but before dynamic routes\n        {\n          source: '/non-existent',\n          destination: '/somewhere-else',\n        },\n      ],\n      fallback: [\n        // These rewrites are checked after both pages/public files\n        // and dynamic routes are checked\n        {\n          source: '/:path*',\n          destination: `https://my-old-site.com/:path*`,\n        },\n      ],\n    }\n  },\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know**: rewrites in `beforeFiles` do not check the filesystem/dynamic routes immediately after matching a source, they continue until all `beforeFiles` have been checked.\n\nThe order Next.js routes are checked is:\n\n<AppOnly>\n\n1. [headers](/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/headers) are checked/applied\n2. [redirects](/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/redirects) are checked/applied\n3. `beforeFiles` rewrites are checked/applied\n4. static files from the [public directory](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/static-assets), `_next/static` files, and non-dynamic pages are checked/served\n5. `afterFiles` rewrites are checked/applied, if one of these rewrites is matched we check dynamic routes/static files after each match\n6. `fallback` rewrites are checked/applied, these are applied before rendering the 404 page and after dynamic routes/all static assets have been checked. If you use [fallback: true/'blocking'](/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/get-static-paths#fallback-true) in `getStaticPaths`, the fallback `rewrites` defined in your `next.config.js` will _not_ be run.\n\n</AppOnly>\n\n<PagesOnly>\n\n1.

Both the `source` and all `has` items must match and all `missing` items must not match for the rewrite to be applied.\n\n`has` and `missing` items can have the following fields:\n\n- `type`: `String` - must be either `header`, `cookie`, `host`, or `query`.\n- `key`: `String` - the key from the selected type to match against.\n- `value`: `String` or `undefined` - the value to check for, if undefined any value will match. A regex like string can be used to capture a specific part of the value, e.g. if the value `first-(?<paramName>.*)` is used for `first-second` then `second` will be usable in the destination with `:paramName`.\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  async rewrites() {\n    return [\n      // if the header `x-rewrite-me` is present,\n      // this rewrite will be applied\n      {\n        source: '/:path*',\n        has: [\n          {\n            type: 'header',\n            key: 'x-rewrite-me',\n          },\n        ],\n        destination: '/another-page',\n      },\n      // if the header `x-rewrite-me` is not present,\n      // this rewrite will be applied\n      {\n        source: '/:path*',\n        missing: [\n          {\n            type: 'header',\n            key: 'x-rewrite-me',\n          },\n        ],\n        destination: '/another-page',\n      },\n      // if the source, query, and cookie are matched,\n      // this rewrite will be applied\n      {\n        source: '/specific/:path*',\n        has: [\n          {\n            type: 'query',\n            key: 'page',\n            // the page value will not be available in the\n            // destination since value is provided and doesn't\n            // use a named capture group e.g. (?<page>home)\n            value: 'home',\n          },\n          {\n            type: 'cookie',\n            key: 'authorized',\n            value: 'true',\n          },\n        ],\n        destination: '/:path*/home',\n      },\n      // if the header `x-authorized` is present and\n      // contains a matching value, this rewrite will be applied\n      {\n        source: '/:path*',\n        has: [\n          {\n            type: 'header',\n            key: 'x-authorized',\n            value: '(?<authorized>yes|true)',\n          },\n        ],\n        destination: '/home?authorized=:authorized',\n      },\n      // if the host is `example.com`,\n      // this rewrite will be applied\n      {\n        source: '/:path*',\n        has: [\n          {\n            type: 'host',\n            value: 'example.com',\n          },\n        ],\n        destination: '/another-page',\n      },\n    ]\n  },\n}\n```\n\n## Rewriting to an external URL\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Examples</summary>\n\n- [Incremental adoption of Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/custom-routes-proxying)\n- [Using Multiple Zones](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-zones)\n\n</details>\n\nRewrites allow you to rewrite to an external url. This is especially useful for incrementally adopting Next.js. The following is an example rewrite for redirecting the `/blog` route of your main app to an external site.\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  async rewrites() {\n    return [\n      {\n        source: '/blog',\n        destination: 'https://example.com/blog',\n      },\n      {\n        source: '/blog/:slug',\n        destination: 'https://example.com/blog/:slug', // Matched parameters can be used in the destination\n      },\n    ]\n  },\n}\n```\n\nIf you're using `trailingSlash: true`, you also need to insert a trailing slash in the `source` parameter. If the destination server is also expecting a trailing slash it should be included in the `destination` parameter as well.\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  trailingSlash: true,\n  async rewrites() {\n    return [\n      {\n        source: '/blog/',\n        destination: 'https://example.com/blog/',\n      },\n      {\n        source: '/blog/:path*/',\n        destination: 'https://example.com/blog/:path*/',\n      },\n    ]\n  },\n}\n```\n\n### Incremental adoption of Next.js\n\nYou can also have Next.js fall back to proxying to an existing website after checking all Next.js routes.\n\nThis way you don't have to change the rewrites configuration when migrating more pages to Next.js\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  async rewrites() {\n    return {\n      fallback: [\n        {\n          source: '/:path*',\n          destination: `https://custom-routes-proxying-endpoint.vercel.app/:path*`,\n        },\n      ],\n    }\n  },\n}\n```\n\n### Rewrites with basePath support\n\nWhen leveraging [`basePath` support](/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/basePath) with rewrites each `source` and `destination` is automatically prefixed with the `basePath` unless you add `basePath: false` to the rewrite:\n\n```js filename=\"next.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  basePath: '/docs',\n\n  async rewrites() {\n    return [\n      {\n        source: '/with-basePath', // automatically becomes /docs/with-basePath\n        destination: '/another', // automatically becomes /docs/another\n      },\n      {\n        // does not add /docs to /without-basePath since basePath: false is set\n        // Note: this can not be used for internal rewrites e.g. `destination: '/another'`\n        source: '/without-basePath',\n        destination: 'https://example.com',\n        basePath: false,\n      },\n    ]\n  },\n}\n```\n\n### Rewrites with i18n support\n\n<AppOnly>\n\nWhen leveraging [`i18n` support](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/internationalization) with rewrites each `source` and `destination` is automatically prefixed to handle the configured `locales` unless you add `locale: false` to the rewrite. If `locale: false` is used you must prefix the `source` and `destination` with a locale for it to be matched correctly.\n\n</AppOnly>\n\n<PagesOnly>\n\nWhen leveraging [`i18n` support](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/internationalization) with rewrites each `source` and `destination` is automatically prefixed to handle the configured `locales` unless you add `locale: false` to the rewrite.
